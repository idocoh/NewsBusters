Article title: Michael Jordan Says I Won’t Release Another Shoe Until Black People Unite
 Article text: “You will stand in line for my shoes but won’t stand up for yourself”

Said Former NBA Star Michael J Jordan after he finally broke his silence about the recent killings of black men. As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement and angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers.



“I am sad to say this but my shoes are part of the problem”

Today’s statement is something of a public milestone for Jordan, who has been criticized over the years for his low profile in political and social advocacy, glad he has stepped up to make a change in whats going on in our crazy world.
