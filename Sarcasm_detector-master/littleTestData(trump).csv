Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. 
In an Oct. 24 response, Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch‚Äôs behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran.

Fox News Sunday reported this morning that Anthony Weiner is cooperating with the FBI, which has re-opened (yes, lefties: ‚Äúre-opened‚Äù) the investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs classified emails. Watch as Chris Wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show: 
And the news is breaking while we‚Äôre on the air. Our colleague Bret Baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that Anthony Weiner, who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife Huma Abedin, is cooperating with the FBI investigation, had given them the laptop, so therefore they didn‚Äôt need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop. Pretty interesting development. 
Targets of federal investigations will often cooperate, hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing. Given Weiner‚Äôs well-known penchant for lying, it‚Äôs hard to believe that a prosecutor would give Weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify, unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence. But cooperation can take many forms ‚Äî and, as Wallace indicated on this morning‚Äôs show, one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow   the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway.

Since March of 2010, the American people have had to suffer under the incredible economic burden of the Affordable Care Act‚ÄîObamacare. This legislation, passed by totally partisan votes in the House and Senate and signed into law by the most divisive and partisan President in American history, has tragically but predictably resulted in runaway costs, websites that don‚Äôt work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition and fewer choices. Obamacare has raised the economic uncertainty of every single person residing in this country. As it appears Obamacare is certain to collapse of its own weight, the damage done by the Democrats and President Obama, and abetted by the Supreme Court, will be difficult to repair unless the next President and a Republican congress lead the effort to bring much-needed free market reforms to the healthcare industry. 
Congress must act. Our elected representatives in the House and Senate must: 
1. Completely repeal Obamacare. Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to. 
2. Modify existing law that inhibits the sale of health insurance across state lines. As long as the plan purchased complies with state requirements, any vendor ought to be able to offer insurance in any state. By allowing full competition in this market, insurance costs will go down and consumer satisfaction will go up. 
3. Allow individuals to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns under the current tax system. Businesses are allowed to take these deductions so why wouldn‚Äôt Congress allow individuals the same exemptions? As we allow the free market to provide insurance coverage opportunities to companies and individuals, we must also make sure that no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance. We must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

NYPD Ready To Make Arrests In Weiner Case‚Ä¶Hillary Visited Pedophile Island At Least 6 Times‚Ä¶Money Laundering, Underage Sex, Pay-for-Play,Proof of Inappropriate Handling Classified Information Blackwater USA Founder, Retired Navy Seal Erik Prince 
Prince claimed he had insider knowledge of the investigation that could help explain why FBI Director James Comey had to announce he was reopening the investigation into Clinton‚Äôs email server last week. 
‚ÄúBecause of Weinergate and the sexting scandal, the NYPD started investigating it. Through a subpoena, through a warrant, they searched his laptop, and sure enough, found those 650,000 emails. They found way more stuff than just more information pertaining to the inappropriate sexting the guy was doing,‚Äù Prince claimed. 
‚ÄúThey found State Department emails. They found a lot of other really damning criminal information, including money laundering, including the fact that Hillary went to this sex island with convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Bill Clinton went there more than 20 times. Hillary Clinton went there at least six times,‚Äù he said. 
‚ÄúThe amount of garbage that they found in these emails, of criminal activity by Hillary, by her immediate circle, and even by other Democratic members of Congress was so disgusting they gave it to the FBI, and they said, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre going to go public with this if you don‚Äôt reopen the investigation and you don‚Äôt do the right thing with timely indictments,‚Äô‚Äù Prince explained. 
‚ÄúI believe ‚Äì I know, and this is from a very well-placed source of mine at 1PP, One Police Plaza in New York ‚Äì the NYPD wanted to do a press conference announcing the warrants and the additional arrests they were making in this investigation, and they‚Äôve gotten huge pushback, to the point of coercion, from the Justice Department, with the Justice Department threatening to charge someone that had been unrelated in the accidental heart attack death of Eric Garner almost two years ago. That‚Äôs the level of pushback the Obama Justice Department is doing against actually seeking justice in the email and other related criminal matters,‚Äù Prince said. 
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs five different parts of the FBI conducting investigations into these things, with constant downdrafts from the Obama Justice Department. So in the, I hope, unlikely and very unfortunate event that Hillary Clinton is elected president, we will have a constitutional crisis that we have not seen since, I believe, 1860,‚Äù Prince declared. 
Marlow asked Prince to clarify these revelations. 
‚ÄúNYPD was the first one to look at that laptop,‚Äù Prince elaborated. ‚ÄúWeiner and Huma Abedin, his wife ‚Äì the closest adviser of Hillary Clinton for 20 years ‚Äì have both flipped. They are cooperating with the government. They both have ‚Äì they see potential jail time of many years for their crimes, for Huma Abedin sending and receiving and even storing hundreds of thousands of messages from the State Department server and from Hillary Clinton‚Äôs own homebrew server, which contained classified information. Weiner faces all kinds of exposure for the inappropriate sexting that was going on and for other information that they found.‚Äù 
‚ÄúSo NYPD first gets that computer. They see how disgusting it is. They keep a copy of everything, and they pass a copy on to the FBI, which finally pushes the FBI off their chairs, making Comey reopen that investigation, which was indicated in the letter last week. The point being, NYPD has all the information, and they will pursue justice within their rights if the FBI doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù Prince contended. 
‚ÄúThere is all kinds of criminal culpability through all the emails they‚Äôve seen of that 650,000, including money laundering, underage sex, pay-for-play, and, of course, plenty of proof of inappropriate handling, sending/receiving of classified information, up to SAP level Special Access Programs,‚Äù he stated. 
‚ÄúSo the plot thickens. NYPD was pushing because, as an article quoted one of the chiefs ‚Äì that‚Äôs the level just below commissioner ‚Äì he said as a parent, as a father with daughters, he could not let that level of evil continue,‚Äù Prince said. 
He noted that the FBI can investigate these matters, ‚Äúbut they can‚Äôt convene a grand jury. They can‚Äôt file charges.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe prosecutors, the Justice Department has to do that,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúNow, as I understand it, Preet Bharara, the Manhattan prosecutor, has gotten ahold of some of this. From what I hear, he‚Äôs a stand-up guy, and hopefully he does the right thing.‚Äù 
Marlow agreed that Bharara‚Äôs ‚Äústerling reputation‚Äù as a determined prosecutor was ‚Äúbad news for the Clintons.‚Äù 
Prince agreed, but said, ‚ÄúIf people are willing to bend or break the law and don‚Äôt really care about the Constitution or due process ‚Äì if you‚Äôre willing to use Stalinist tactics against someone ‚Äì who knows what level of pressure‚Äù could be brought to bear against even the most tenacious law enforcement officials? 
Listen to interview here: 
‚ÄúThe point being, fortunately, it‚Äôs not just the FBI; [there are] five different offices that are in the hunt for justice, but the NYPD has it as well,‚Äù Prince said, citing the Wall Street Journal reporting that has ‚Äúexposed downdraft, back pressure from the Justice Department‚Äù against both the FBI and NYPD, in an effort to ‚Äúkeep the sunlight and the disinfecting effects of the truth and transparency from shining on this great evil that has gone on, and is slowly being exposed.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe Justice Department is trying to run out the clock, to elect Hillary Clinton, to prevent any real justice from being done,‚Äù he warned. 
As for the mayor of New York City, Prince said he has heard that ‚Äúde Blasio wants to stay away from this.‚Äù 
‚ÄúThe evidence is so bad, the email content is so bad, that I think even he wants to stay away from it, which is really telling,‚Äù he said.

Democrat Dr. Brenda Snipes was appointed by Jeb Bush in 2003 and is no stranger to controversy. On October 20, the Sun Sentinal reported that former Oakland Park Commissioner Anne Sallee noticed something troubling about her vote-by-mail ballot. It is missing Constitutional Amendment 2, the medical marijuana question. 
Sallee, now Broward chapter director of the Florida Restaurant and Lodging Association, knows her way around government. Yet she said she spent a week unsuccessfully trying to get someone at the Broward elections office to pay attention to her complaint. 
She was cleared on Wednesday of another election snafu, the early posting of primary election results. Her office also was criticized for sending out inaccurate voter ID cards, and for printing ballots for November that include the word ‚Äúno‚Äù in the ‚Äúyes‚Äù line on the county‚Äôs transportation sales surtax question.

And finally, this ridiculous and totally biased email was sent from University of Michigan President to the students offering them assistance to help them through the results of our Presidential election last night. The President wants to ensure the students that the university remains committed to their ‚Äúmost important responsibility‚Äù at their school which is apparently, ‚Äúto remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ‚Äì and to diversity, equity and inclusion.‚Äù: 
To All Members of the University Community: 
As I‚Äôm sure many of you did, I watched the election coverage late into the night, and had the opportunity to visit with students and staff at a results-watching event sponsored by the Ginsberg Center at the Michigan Union. It will take quite some time to completely absorb the results from yesterday‚Äôs election, understand the full implications, and discern the long-term impact on our university and our nation . More immediately, in the aftermath of a close and highly contentious election we continue to embrace our most important responsibility as a university community. Our responsibility is to remain committed to education, discovery and intellectual honesty ‚Äì and to diversity, equity and inclusion. We are at our best when we come together to engage respectfully across our ideological differences; to support ALL who feel marginalized, threatened or unwelcome; and to pursue knowledge and understanding, as we always have, as the students, faculty and staff of the University of Michigan. There are reports of members of our community offering support to one another. Students are planning a vigil tonight on the Diag at 6 p.m. Our Center for Research on Teaching and Learning also has numerous resources available for faculty seeking help in cultivating classroom environments that are responsive to national issues. I also want to make everyone aware of some of the plans and events we have had in place for today and beyond. ¬∑ Our Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy is holding a Post-Election Analysis from 4 to 5:30 p.m. today in the Weill Hall‚Äôs Annenberg Auditorium. Speakers include former U.S. Congressman John Dingell, former Ambassador Ron Weiser, and faculty members Mara Ostfeld, Betsey Stevenson and Marina Whitman. ¬∑ Our History Department has organized a community discussion led by faculty and students to include historical perspectives at 6 p.m. tonight in 1014 Tisch Hall. ¬∑ The Office of Student Life will provide resources and referrals for support on campus to students, faculty and staff at a location in the Michigan Union‚Äôs Willis Ward Lounge. It will be open today from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. ¬∑ Our Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Affairs is offering an open space of support to help members of our community connect during open hours today. MESA‚Äôs office is in the Michigan Union, Room 2202. ¬∑ Tomorrow, our Ginsberg Center and Counseling and Psychological Services office is facilitating a Post-election Dialogue: Impact, Perspective-taking, and Moving Forward. This event is part of the Student Life Professional Development Conference at 1 ‚Äì 2 p.m. in the Michigan League‚Äôs Henderson Room. I know that other schools, colleges and offices across our campus are planning events as well. I thank everyone who is helping us come together and ask anyone scheduling a post election event post it on the University of Michigan Events Calendar. I hope all of us will continue to proudly embrace the opportunities before us as the students, faculty and staff of a great public research university governed by the people. Elections are often times of great change, but the values we stand for at U-M have been shaped over the course of nearly 200 years. Our mission remains as essential for society as ever: ‚Äú‚Ä¶to serve the people of Michigan and the world through preeminence in creating, communicating, preserving and applying knowledge, art, and academic values, and in developing leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future.‚Äù I look forward to working together with all of you to advance the work we do in service of the public ‚Äì and to ensure that the University of Michigan will always be a welcoming place for all members of society.

MATH SHOWS Trump Would Have Beaten Obama In Romney-Obama Election ¬ª 100percentfedUp.com","Email For Republican politicians like Ohio Governor John Kasich who refused to get behind Donald J. Trump‚Ä¶it turns out Trump was right‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt need you. In spite of the massive media force who came out against him, and the ‚Äònever Trumpers‚Äô from his own party who worked very hard to defeat him, if Obama was running against Donald J. Trump today, Trump would have beaten him‚Ä¶ 
It‚Äôs easy to glance at Tuesday‚Äôs popular vote ‚Äî which, with 92 percent of all precincts reporting, shows Hillary Clinton with six million fewer votes than Barack Obama won in 2012 ‚Äì and reach the conclusion that Clinton lost the White House because she failed to turn out the Democratic base. But the truth is much more complicated. While she underperformed relative to Obama‚Äôs 2012 totals in several Midwestern states ‚Äî Ohio, Michigan, Iowa, and Wisconsin ‚Äî Clinton ran virtually even with Obama in the battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia, Nevada, and New Hampshire. What‚Äôs more, she far surpassed Obama‚Äôs 2012 vote total in Florida, the country‚Äôs biggest swing state. Yet somehow, while Obama carried Florida, Clinton lost it. Which brings us to an important question: Was Donald Trump just good enough to beat a bad Democratic opponent on Tuesday, or does he deserve far more credit? Could he, for instance, have competed with the vaunted Obama machine? The answer, somewhat shockingly, is yes. 
A review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that Trump 2016 would have defeated Obama 2012 in the electoral college. (Disclaimer: This obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same, nor are any two electorates. Still, unlike debating whether the 2016 Cubs would defeat the 1927 Yankees, this is not an entirely abstract argument; a comparison of their respective performances in the country‚Äôs most competitive states shows Trump edging Obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup.) The math might seem impossible. After all, Obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012; Trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million, which will actually be one million fewer votes than Mitt Romney won. How, then, could Trump have topped Obama in the electoral college? The answer: Republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation‚Äôs most critical battleground states. Let‚Äôs look at them individually, in descending order by population, and do the electoral-vote math. The 2016 totals aren‚Äôt yet final because not all precincts have reported.

He and his family have already sacrificed so much because he chose to put his country first. Making sacrifices is certainly not something loudmouth liberals like Robert DeNiro are accustomed to. DeNiro was very vocal about his opposition to the wildly successful business man Donald J. Trump. He felt so strongly about his hate for Trump that made a video where he angrily stated he‚Äôd like to, ‚Äúpunch him in the face.‚Äù Now that Trump won the election in a landslide, DeNiro has chosen to get behind the Trump rioters who are terrorizing cities across America. Anti-Trump rioters are breaking windows, using baseball bats to smash the windshields of innocent citizens who get trapped in their hellish protests as they try to escape. Women who are taking part in the protests are being punched in the faces by men who are also taking part in the George Soros funded protests. American flags are being burned and families who are walking in major cities are being subjected to the most vile and disgusting, hateful language and images imaginable. If this is the kind of America that Robert DiNero is openly supporting? And if so, why would any American pay to see his movie,‚ÄùComedian‚Äù? 
Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù the tycoon‚Äôs win in the presidential election had made him. 
The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film ‚ÄúThe Comedian‚Äù in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump‚Äôs victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. 
‚ÄúHow am I doing? I‚Äôm very depressed,‚Äù the famously laconic ‚ÄúRaging Bull‚Äù actor told reporters. 
‚ÄúWe have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.‚Äù 
Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday‚Äôs election, he replied: ‚ÄúYes, absolutely. Things aren‚Äôt being done right.‚Äù 
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday. 
In Manhattan, they held signs reading ‚ÄúYour Wall Can‚Äôt Stand in Our Way‚Äù ‚Äî a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico. 
De Niro hasn‚Äôt minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as ‚Äúa punk,‚Äù ‚Äúa pig‚Äù and ‚Äúan idiot.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to punch him in the face,‚Äù he said before the election. 
Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro‚Äôs grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape. 
‚ÄúIf, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him,‚Äù said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano.

The Forgotten Man painting is amazing in its symbolism. 
Here‚Äôs how McNaughton describes the painting: 
Against the background of a darkening sky, all of the past Presidents of the United States gather before the White House, as if to commemorate some great event. In the left hand corner of the painting sits a man. That man, with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future. Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say, ‚ÄúWhat have you done?‚Äù Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind. Crumpled dollar bills, legislative documents, and, like a whisper‚Äîthe U.S. Constitution beneath the foot of Barack Obama. 
THE FORGOTTEN MAN‚Ä¶ 
McNaughton never sells his original paintings BUT he made an exception this time. He sold this painting to Sean Hannity so Hannity could give it to Donald Trump. Awesome, huh?

She put our national security at grave risk by leaving top classified emails on her private server, and she took money from nations who throw gays off rooftops and treat women worse than cockroaches. She is likely very sick and would be unlikely to serve out her first term without someone there to prop her up, but nevertheless, I supported her anyhow, because she‚Äôs a Democrat and has a vagina. Someone told me she still has a chance of winning the presidency if I just signed a petition. They said that Trump really didn‚Äôt win, because Hillary won the popular vote. Is that true? 
Okay, let‚Äôs address this ‚ÄúHillary might win the popular vote, isn‚Äôt that Electoral College situation just awful‚Äù thing head on. 
No, it‚Äôs not awful. It‚Äôs great, and it protects the importance of your vote. It‚Äôs also uniquely American and demonstrates yet again the once-in-creation brilliance of the Founding Fathers. 
First of all, she‚Äôs probably not going to win the actual number of votes cast. She may win the number of votes counted, but not the votes cast. 
States don‚Äôt count their absentee ballots unless the number of outstanding absentee ballots is larger than the state margin of difference. If there is a margin of 1,000 votes counted and there are 1,300 absentee ballots outstanding, then the state tabulates those. If the number of outstanding absentee ballots wouldn‚Äôt influence the election results, then the absentee ballots aren‚Äôt counted. 
Who votes by absentee ballot? Students overseas, the military, businesspeople on trips, etc. The historical breakout for absentee ballots is about 67-33% Republican. In 2000, when Al Gore ‚Äúwon‚Äù the popular vote nationally by 500,000 votes and the liberal media screamed bloody murder, there were 2 million absentee ballots in California alone. A 67-33 breakout of those yields a 1.33- to 0.667-million Republican vote advantage, so Bush would have gotten a 667,000-vote margin from California‚Äôs uncounted absentee ballots alone! So much for Gore‚Äôs 500,000 popular vote ‚Äúvictory.‚Äù (That was the headline on the N.Y. Times, and it was the lead story on NBC Nightly News, right? No? You‚Äôre kidding.) 
Getting back to the ‚Äúwin the popular vote/lose the Electoral College‚Äù scenario: Thank G-d we have that, or else California and N.Y. would determine every election. Every time. 
But the Electoral College brilliantly smooths out the variances in the voting proclivities among states and regions. Farmers in the middle of the country and importers and exporters on the shore get roughly equal say, as do Madison Ave. execs and factory workers in Tennessee. 
Shortcomings? Sure. The E.C. can make an R vote meaningless in a very few heavily D states or vice versa. But without the Electoral College, the country‚Äôs entire population is subject to the disproportionate voting preferences of the few most populous states. ‚Äì American Thinker Comment on this Article Via Your Facebook Account Comment on this Article Via Your Disqus Account Follow Us on Facebook!","english","2016-11-13T06:02:47.949+02:00","100percentfedup.com","US",25689,"SORRY LIBERALS‚Ä¶You Can Stop With The Petitions‚Ä¶Hillary Did NOT Win The Popular Vote",0,"http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2546106-thumb.jpg",0,1,0,0,0,"bias"

Speaking at the Texas Conference For Women at the Austin Convention Center on Tuesday, the international human rights lawyer, and wife of George Clooney, said she had concerns about America‚Äôs reputation under the real estate mogul‚Äôs plans. 
She noted that Trump‚Äôs comments during his campaign, ‚Äòthat there should be a religious test imposed on entering the U.S. or the fact that there should be state-sponsored torture or that families of suspected terrorists should all be killed ‚Äî all of those things are violations of international human rights law and the values that underlie that.‚Äô 
The 38-year-old wife said America‚Äôs reputation as a country with a strong human rights record and high moral standing was at risk. 
‚ÄòI think there‚Äôs some concern from abroad as to, ‚ÄúAre these things actually going to happen?‚Äù, or is the U.S. going to lose some of the moral standing that it has internationally,‚Äô according to the Hollywood Reporter. 
Perhaps its time to put our nation‚Äôs security and sovereignty before we worry about what people in other countries around the world think of us‚Ä¶ 
Both Amal and her Hollywood actor husband George, a staunch Hillary Clinton supporter, have spoken out against Trump in the past. 
Earlier this year, Amal Clooney called for Trump to be challenged on his extreme views. 
Watch George Clooney here whine about press giving Trump too much favorable press: 
‚ÄòWhen you listen to what the leading candidate on the Republican side has been saying about building walls, about excluding Mexicans and a complete shutdown of all Muslims entering in, and if you actually look at what he specifically said in that now infamous speech about Muslims, he kept saying, ‚ÄòThey only want jihad. They don‚Äôt believe in our way of life. They don‚Äôt respect our system,‚Äù Clooney said. Via: Daily Mail  ","english","2016-11-20T03:53:12.132+02:00","100percentfedup.com","US",25689,"LOL!

They had to know they had it coming‚Ä¶ 
Donald Trump scolded media big shots during an off-the-record Trump Tower sitdown on Monday, sources told The Post. 
‚ÄúIt was like a f‚Äìing firing squad,‚Äù one source said of the encounter. 
‚ÄúTrump started with [CNN chief] Jeff Zucker and said ‚ÄòI hate your network, everyone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed,‚Äô ‚Äù the source said. 
‚ÄúThe meeting was a total disaster. The TV execs and anchors went in there thinking they would be discussing the access they would get to the Trump administration, but instead they got a Trump-style dressing down,‚Äù the source added. 
A second source confirmed the fireworks. 
‚ÄúThe meeting took place in a big board room and there were about 30 or 40 people, including the big news anchors from all the networks,‚Äù the other source said. 
‚ÄúTrump kept saying, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre in a room of liars, the deceitful dishonest media who got it all wrong.‚Äô He addressed everyone in the room calling the media dishonest, deceitful liars. He called out Jeff Zucker by name and said everyone at CNN was a liar, and CNN was [a] network of liars,‚Äù the source said. 
‚ÄúTrump didn‚Äôt say [NBC reporter] Katy Tur by name, but talked about an NBC female correspondent who got it wrong, then he referred to a horrible network correspondent who cried when Hillary lost who hosted a debate ‚Äì which was Martha Raddatz who was also in the room.‚Äù 
The stunned reporters tried to get a word in edgewise to discuss access to a Trump Administration. 
‚Äú[CBS Good Morning co-host Gayle] King did not stand up, but asked some question, ‚ÄòHow do you propose we the media work with you?‚Äô Chuck Todd asked some pretty pointed questions. David Muir asked ‚ÄòHow are you going to cope living in DC while your family is in NYC? It was a horrible meeting.‚Äù 
Here‚Äôs a sampling of Trump hitting back at the dishonest media while he was on the campaign trail. Trump did something no other presidential candidate has ever done before, he won the election in a landslide, in spite of the entire fake news empire working together to take him down: 
Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway told reporters the gathering went well. 
‚ÄúExcellent meetings with the top executives of the major networks,‚Äù she said during a gaggle in the lobby of Trump Tower. ‚ÄúPretty unprecedented meeting we put together in two days.‚Äù 
The meeting was off the record, meaning the participants agreed not to talk about the substance of the conversations. 
The hour-long session included top execs from network and cable news channels. Among the attendees were NBC‚Äôs Deborah Turness, Lester Holt and Chuck Todd, ABC‚Äôs James Goldston, George Stephanopoulos, David Muir and Martha Raddatz, 
Also, CBS‚Äô Norah O‚ÄôDonnell John Dickerson, Charlie Rose, Christopher Isham and King, Fox News‚Äô Bill Shine, Jack Abernethy, Jay Wallace, Suzanne Scott, MSNBC‚Äôs Phil Griffin and CNN‚Äôs Jeff Zucker and Erin Burnett. -Via : NYP  ","english","2016-11-22T08:17:53.961+02:00","100percentfedup.com","US",25689,"DONALD TRUMP Calls Meeting With Press‚Ä¶Dresses Down Real Fake News Networks: ‚ÄúEveryone at CNN is a liar and you should be ashamed‚Äù",0,"http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/2582326-thumb.jpg",0,1,0,0,0,"bias"

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
21WIRE reported on Friday about the FBI‚Äôs surprising announcement that it would be reopening the Clinton email case due to new evidence of ‚Äòclassified information‚Äô found on sex cheat Anthony Weiner‚Äôs (newly estranged husband of Clinton chief aid Huma Abedin) computer which was subject to a seperate investigation. Will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days running-up to the Nov 8th election, or is this just clever Democrat party smoke and mirrors? It seems that Washington‚Äôs political tricksters have already sprung into action‚Ä¶ 
After Comey‚Äôs shock announcement, a ‚Äúleaked‚Äù memo appeared out of nowhere, supplied to Fox News , in which Comey and the FBI seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control. 
ELITE CIRCLES: FBI head James Comey and friend Hillary Clinton. 
Certainly, a desperate Democratic Party, and an even more desperate Obama White House (over the last 3 weeks, Obama and his wife Michelle have been out campaigning more that Hillary Clinton herself), could be pressuring or nudging the FBI on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against Donald Trump. Aside from the obvious potential of another Clinton scandal, yesterday‚Äôs FBI move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios: Protect the President, who is already deeply tied to the Clinton email cover-up Democratic Party Machine has created a distraction to cover-up latest Wikileaks dump. FBI are trying to restore lost public confidence over allegations of favoring Hillary Clintons. Create a controlled explosion this weekend to clear the decks for another salacious Trump scandal next week. 
NOTE: Despite calls from the Clinton camp for FBI to disclose what they have (which they cannot by law anyway, you‚Äôd think Hillary would have already known that), it is highly unlikely that the FBI will release any real specifics before the election ‚Äì if they have anything at all. It‚Äôs just too early to tell. 
SEE ALSO: FBI James Comey was board member of HSBC ‚Äì Clinton Foundation & Drug Cartel ‚Äòbank of choice‚Äô 
The FBI director stoked outrage last month when he announced that he would not recommend the Justice Department seek an indictment against Clinton or any of the other parties to the investigation ‚Äì allowing Clinton to dodge any criminal probe before the election ‚Äì despite the fact that Comey stated to a Congressional investigative committee that Clinton was ‚Äúextremely careless,‚Äù and that Clinton openly lied about her handling classified information on her unsecured private server throughout her tenure as the US Secretary of State. 
Zero Hedge adds: 
‚ÄúNow, it is the democrats turn to rage at Comey and the FBI, although Comey likely did not have much choice: had he kept the information secret, it certainly would have leaked as we predicted; as such his best recourse was to come clean, although many have speculated about the cryptic nature of the disclosure. Needless to say, all Comey would need to do to regain the Demcorats‚Äô trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over.‚Äù 
Here is ‚Äúleaked‚Äù (aka ‚Äòjust covering my ass) memo from FBI director James Comey:

In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton. 
‚ÄòNEW PROBE‚Äô‚Äì The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. (Photo illustraion 21WIRE) 
FBI October Surprise? 
According to reports , in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey , stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton‚Äôs personal email server. 
CNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey‚Äôs letter discussing the new investigation: 
‚ÄúIn previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton‚Äôs personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,‚Äù Comey wrote. 
In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,‚Äù he added. 
Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,‚Äù Comey concluded.‚Äù 
Huma‚Äôs Estranged ‚ÄòSexting‚Äô Husband 
According to a new report released via The New York Times : 
‚ÄúThe presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton ‚Äôs private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide.‚Äù ‚Äú In a letter to Congress , the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide.‚Äù Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her ‚Äòhome brew‚Äô email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled. 
This unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton ‚Äòs private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under ‚ÄúBill Clinton, Inc.,‚Äù with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years. 
The following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation‚Ä¶ 
The new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new ‚ÄòPay-to-Play‚Äô allegations , as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit ‚Äòlarge-scale‚Äô voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies. Out of Creamer‚Äôs 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times. White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47 ‚Äúprivate meetings with Obama or his senior staff,‚Äù also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics ‚Äì thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability. ‚ÄòCAUGHT ON FILM‚Äô ‚Äì Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy. (Image Source: CNN ) Creamer, a convicted felon , (in 2005, Creamer plead guilty $2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations) was promptly ‚Äúshoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaign‚Äôs inner circle,‚Äù following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies. ‚ÄòPAY TO PLAY?‚Äô‚Äì Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe closely allied with the Clinton‚Äôs negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the FBI. (Image Source new republic ) It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate , Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe , ‚Äúhelped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private email system, according to a report.‚Äù The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: 
‚ÄúThe political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal . 
The report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe. 
The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate‚Äôs husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau.‚Äù 
In a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations, ‚Äú‚Ä¶According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton‚Äôs email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling ‚Äúpressured‚Äù by another FBI official at Kennedy‚Äôs request.‚Äù 
The newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there‚Äôs no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates ‚Äì the agency needed to save face. 
It remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election.

Over the weekend, it was discovered through a Wikileaks email dump, that Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress , John Podesta ‚Äòs top aide, had an email exchange with Michael Lux of Progressive Strategies revealing that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, was closely allied with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook .

Creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative non-profit Project Veritas . Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera ‚Äì he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials.

Creamer‚Äôs visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky . 
White House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47 ‚Äúprivate meetings with Obama or his senior staff,‚Äù over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics , potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability. 
The Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile , is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Here‚Äôs a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario: 
‚ÄúDonna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show.‚Äù 
The article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined: 
‚ÄúIn the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions [Roland] Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôll send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted,‚Äù Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled ‚ÄúFrom time to time I get the questions in advance.‚Äù 
Martin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now , as well as a CNN contributor. 
In another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following , while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments: 
‚ÄúThe latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe [of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal], the bureau‚Äôs second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter.‚Äù 
Some critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received $675,000 from a well-known Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe . This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons. 
The alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates ‚Äòobjected‚Äô to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week ‚Äì something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case. 
According to a report filed by Zero Hedge , a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik , the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin , Clintion‚Äôs closest aide. 
Interestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort , over his alleged foreign business connections. 
Back in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news : 
‚ÄúIn 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manafort‚Äôs firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was $850 million. Firtash‚Äôs company planned to invest over $100 million, the records say. 
That same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine.‚Äù 
Although the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia ‚Äì so far, there‚Äôs nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time. 
Watch this space ‚Äì as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown.

WikiLeaks: Trump Rally Agitator and Clinton Campaign Manager Are ‚ÄòClose‚Äô 
Top Clinton aides discussed Bob Creamer and his ‚Äògrassroots/netroots‚Äô operation 
by Jim Stinson LifeZette 
Robert Creamer, the operative behind sending provocateurs to Donald Trump rallies, was close to Robby Mook, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager, according to new emails released by WikiLeaks. 
Creamer, who allegedly spearheaded the dirty tricks for the Democrats, wasn‚Äôt just consulting for the Democratic National Committee, according to videos made by Project Veritas. He was sending people to provoke Trump at events. 
Creamer has thus become a red-hot issue in the campaign. And now it‚Äôs apparent he is close to Mook. That surprising detail came out Sunday morning when WikiLeaks posted hundreds more emails from John Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account. Podesta is Clinton‚Äôs campaign chairman whose account was hacked in March.

Patrick Henningsen 21st Century Wire 
The longer this soap opera drags on, it‚Äôs becoming more and more evident that the Russian government did not ‚Äòhack‚Äô into the DNC, and Moscow is not feeding John Podesta‚Äôs emails to Wikileaks. For those who are deeply invested in this now official conspiracy theory, this might be a hard pill to swallow. 
The White House and the Hillary Clinton campaign are now married to the idea that ‚ÄòPutin is hacking the US elections.‚Äô In response, the President is weighing his options ‚Äì tougher economic sanctions, revoking diplomatic status to Russian envoys in the US, or even deploying his newly developed ‚Äòmalicious cyber-activity‚Äô tools. 
Even VP Joe Biden wants in on the action, threatening Moscow by saying,‚ÄùWe‚Äôre sending a message. We have the capacity to do it.‚Äù 
It seems that where ever you turn nowadays, someone in Washington is issuing a threat against Russia. Are US-Russian relations really that bad, or does this trend have more to do with the defense industry and power struggles within the US? 
What was previously a stance reserved for right-wing neoconservative hawks and Cold War hold-outs has now infected America‚Äôs left-wing, and is a firm plank in the Democratic Party platform, as evidenced by Hillary Clinton‚Äôs constant anti-Russian rhetoric throughout this 2016 election cycle. Along with the White House, Clinton has now transformed the Democrats into the vanguard of Washington‚Äôs new anti-Russia movement. 
On July 27th, Josh Rogin from the Washington Post wrote, ‚ÄúThe Clinton campaign has decided to escalate its rhetoric on Russia. After Trump suggested Wednesday that if Russia had indeed hacked Clinton‚Äôs private email server it should release the emails, the Clinton campaign sent out its Democratic surrogates to bash Russia and Trump in a manner traditionally reserved for Republicans.‚Äù 
Anyone who was paying attention back then knew this ‚ÄòRussian hack‚Äô talking point was purely political, but then again, who‚Äôs really paying attention these days? Certainly not the US media. 
You can trace the genesis of the Democratic Party‚Äôs hardcore anti-Russian strategy back to when President Vladimir Putin made a mild passing remark about Donald Trump‚Äôs GOP primary success. From that point on, Trump‚Äôs political opponents saw this as an open target. In their words, ‚Äòcomparing one dictator to another.‚Äô 
Never one to pass up an opportunity to score cheap political points, President Obama got in on the act, intensifying the Trump-Putin narrative to the level of bromance . ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôve made a career out of idealizing Ronald Reagan, then where were you when your own party‚Äôs nominee for president was kissing up to Vladimir Putin?‚Äù said Obama on Oct 20th at a Clinton rally in Miami. 
Backed by the Obama White House, Clinton and the media felt they had a green light to keep pressing ahead with blaming Russia ‚Äì not only for the controversial DNC leaks, but also for hacking into US election systems in Arizona ‚Äì a charge devoid of any evidence other than innuendo and speculation. The media‚Äôs coverage on this issue was deceptive from the onset. In a leading news release, entitled, ‚Äú Russian hackers targeted Arizona election system ,‚Äù we can see how after the cock-sure headline, the first paragraph would always sound definitive: 
‚ÄúHackers targeted voter registration systems in Illinois and Arizona, and the FBI alerted Arizona officials in June that Russians were behind the assault on the election system in that state.‚Äù 
But then by the time you advanced down the story, the report would quickly retreat into a zone of uncertainty: 
‚ÄúThe bureau described the threat as ‚Äúcredible‚Äù and significant, ‚Äúan eight on a scale of one to 10,‚Äù Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizona Secretary of State Michele Reagan (R), said Monday. As a result, Reagan shut down the state‚Äôs voter registration system for nearly a week.‚Äù 
And then, down to almost nothing‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄúIt turned out that the hackers had not compromised the state system or even any county system. They had, however, stolen the username and password of a single election official in Gila County.‚Äù 
At no point was any evidence ever given. Only ambiguous statements like, ‚ÄúCyber security officials agree that this looks very much like a Russian government-directed hack.‚Äù 
Are American politicians so callous as to tempt geopolitical conflict in order to further their short-term political ambitions? Better yet, has American political life really arrived in such a dark cul de sac (translated in French: ‚Äòbottom of the bag‚Äô) where politicians in power are so insecure as to make-up and propagate wild international conspiracy theories ‚Äì in the middle a national election cycle? It‚Äôs a very depressing prospect, and yet, this is exactly what we are seeing in this 2016 Presidential Election. 
Behind Clinton‚Äôs wild hyperbolic rants about the Kremlin and Wikileaks, you will find the White House‚Ä¶ 
On October 7th, the Obama Administration formally accused the Russian government of stealing emails from the Democratic National Committee and other high-profile individuals including Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign manager John Podesta ‚Äì giving them to Wikileaks. 
Soon, there was a queue of ‚Äònational security‚Äô politicians eager to hitch a ride on this bandwagon. Senator Ben Sasse (NE-R), a member of the Homeland Security Committee spouted out, ‚ÄúRussia must face serious consequences. Moscow orchestrated these hacks because [Russian President Vladimir] Putin believes Soviet-style aggression is worth it. The United States must upend Putin‚Äôs calculus with a strong diplomatic, political, ¬≠cyber and economic response.‚Äù 
According to a Washington Post report by technology editor, Ellen Nakashima , the only ‚Äòevidence‚Äô that seems to be available on this story is a corporate analysis of the alleged ‚ÄòRussian government hacks‚Äô‚Äì provided by a US cyber security company called Crowdstrike . No actual specifics are given, so we are meant to take private firm Crowdstrike‚Äôs word for it. 
IMAGE: Crowdstrike cyber security. 
The Post‚Äôs Nakashima then added: 
‚ÄúThe administration also blamed Moscow for the hack of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the subsequent leak of private email addresses and cellphone numbers of Democratic lawmakers.‚Äù 
An online persona calling himself Guccifer 2.0 has claimed responsibility for posting the material. Those sites and that persona are ‚Äúconsistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts,‚Äù the joint statement said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia‚Äôs senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.‚Äù 
Moscow‚Äôs press secretary‚Äôs reply: ‚ÄúThis is some sort of nonsense,‚Äù said Dmitry Peskov. 
Despite the constant repetition by Democrat media surrogates, and as CNN‚Äôs Maria Cardona said last night, no US national intelligence agency has really ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù that Russia was behind the email hacks ‚Äì and still no evidence , other than speculative guesswork, has been presented. 
Likewise, US intelligence agencies have never actually said definitively on record that ‚ÄúRussia did it,‚Äù thus, leaving the door open to walk-back the accusation at a later date. Standard Washington procedure of ambiguity. This little detail doesn‚Äôt seem to matter in this hyperbolic political climate though. It seems that the White House, Hillary Clinton and media operatives like Cardona ‚Äì are quite happy living in what John Kerry recent dubbed as a ‚Äò parallel universe .‚Äô 
Still, during the final Presidential debate, Hillary Clinton proudly crowed how ‚Äú 17 US intelligence agencies ‚Äù aka the ‚ÄúIntelligence Community‚Äù‚Äì all agreed that Russia did it. 
The announcement, albeit vague, actually originated from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
‚ÄúWe have 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin, and they are designed to influence our election,‚Äù said Clinton. ‚ÄúI find that deeply disturbing.‚Äù 
What‚Äôs even more disturbing is the fact that Clinton is lying in front of a national audience. The highest levels of the Kremlin? Here are Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äô17 agencies‚Äô: 
Air Force Intelligence, Army Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency, Coast Guard Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency, Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, State Department, Treasury Department, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Marine Corps Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, National Security Agency, Navy Intelligence and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. 
What does the Coast Guard Intelligence, National Geospatial Intelligence Agency or the Drug Enforcement Administration know about John Podesta‚Äôs emails? Answer: nothing. 
The exact same thing happened following Wikileaks first trove of DNC emails back in July 2016 . The US government issued a vague accusatory statement, but would not actually name the culprit. Some might call that propaganda. 
In both instances, the Obama Administration refused to present any evidence. Translated: there was no evidence. If there had been, the White House would have been shouting from the rooftops and using it as leverage to apply muscle in the UN over Washington‚Äôs flagging efforts in Syria. Both Obama Administration announcements were nothing more than dog whistles for Democrats and ‚Äújournalists‚Äù working for hopelessly partisan outlets like New York Times and CNN ‚Äì none of whom have bothered to press the White House for one ounce of evidence pertaining to the Party‚Äôs decree that ‚ÄúRussian is hacking the US election process.‚Äù If you actually look at the joint DNI-DHS statement issued on the matter, it contains no definitive statement: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ [the hacks] are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow ‚Äî the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia‚Äôs senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.‚Äù According to NSA intelligence worker-turned whistleblower William Binney , when asked about WikiLeaks and whether the Russians are ‚Äòhacking‚Äô US elections, he concluded that the cyber efforts against the DNC were more likely to be the work of a ‚Äú disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker. ‚Äù 
Under partisan pressure from senior Democrat Senator Harry Reid , the FBI also initiated another investigation into ‚Äúpeople linked to the Trump team with Russia.‚Äù Reid was unset about the DNC hacks and the Podesta emails and demanded the FBI do something about the Trump campaign. To date, the FBI haven‚Äôt come up with anything. 
To be fair, Hillary would have every reason to believe that the Kremlin is behind the hack ‚Äì because her staff read it to her from the campaign‚Äôs daily intelligence briefings, presumably, supplied from the US government‚Äôs much vaunted Intelligence Community . Of course, that‚Äôs the same Intelligence Community that briefed George W Bush about Saddam‚Äôs nonexistent nuclear weapons program, and who also briefed Colin Powell about Iraq‚Äôs imaginary ‚ÄúWinnebagos of Death‚Äù aka mobile anthrax labs disguised as senior double-wide camper vans. So, of course, they would know if Putin directed the DNC leaks and Podesta email hacks. 
For those us who are skeptical of the great oxymoron known as ‚ÄòWashington Intelligence,‚Äô I can almost hear the mainstream rebuttal now, ‚ÄúNo, that was Iraq, that was Bush. We‚Äôre not like that. No, this time it‚Äôs different. This time we are sure the Russians did it!‚Äù 
In 2014, Obama claimed that Kim‚Äôs notorious ‚ÄúBureau 121‚Äù hacked into Sony Pictures. 
This isn‚Äôt the first time that President Obama has cried wolf on a foreign ‚Äòhack‚Äô and then tried to sell it for political purposes. Back in December 2014, Obama claimed that North Korea had hacked Sony Pictures in Hollywood. Pentagon-CIA media proxy CNN quickly chimed in to support Washington‚Äôs conspiracy theory, floating a colorful story that Kim Jing-Un had deployed a secret underground hacking unit called ‚Äò Bureau 121 .‚Äô Just like with today‚Äôs ‚ÄúRussian Hack‚Äù theory, no member of the mainstream press dared to question the White House‚Äôs ridiculous North Korean claim, and like the ‚ÄòRussian Hack‚Äô claims, the only source cited for Sony hack was analysis provided by US firm Crowdstrike . 
Jumping the Shark 
After their Democratic Party Convention on July 27th, the Clinton campaign machine put all of its chips on their Putin narrative. 
Soon after, a cadre of top Clinton national security surrogates then accused Trump of emboldening Russia in their evil plot to ‚Äúdestabilize and dominate the West.‚Äù Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser then accused Russia of ‚Äòinterfering‚Äô with elections all over Europe and then accused Trump is helping Russia directly. At that point, they were in too deep to turn back. The biggest impact of @wikileaks ? Shining a spotlight on Russia‚Äôs attempt to undermine American democracy and Trump‚Äôs refusal to condemn it https://t.co/ALzpYm1Bb5 
‚Äî Josh Schwerin (@JoshSchwerin) October 21, 2016 
Clinton spin doctors Josh Schwerin and Michael Fallon would stoop even lower by accusing RT of having possession of the Podesta emails even before Wikileaks did. Their only ‚Äòevidence‚Äô seemed to be Twitter posts by RT News which Clinton held up as ‚Äòproof‚Äô that the Kremlin was front-running Wikileaks email dumps. The Clinton braintrust failed to note that the Podesta emails were posted on Wikileaks own website well before RT News had tweeted about them. At that point it became obvious that the Clinton campaign was panicking and hysterically grabbing for any excuse they could get their hands on. We then watched, as one RT reporter after another dismantled the Clinton campaign‚Äôs desperate claims. It was embarrassing. 
They could not face the uncomfortable fact that it was WikiLeaks head Julian Assange who chose the timing of the release of the DNC and Podesta emails. Rather than attack Assange himself, who happens to be popular with millennials (the very group Clinton struggles to connect with), her operatives opted to target Russia and Trump instead. 
Either way, the political strategy here is clear ‚Äì to shoot the messenger . The Clinton campaign is stuck in permanent rear-guard mode, because based on the content of both the DNC Leaks, Wikileaks files, and Project Veritas video ‚Äì their own Democratic Party has been discredited and exposed as a corrupt political organization. 
Their other big problem is that despite all the outrage from Democrats and their mainstream media surrogates, none of the leaked content has been challenged on the basis of its authenticity. The results speak for themselves. The initial DNC leak of 20,000 emails resulted in the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz . They revealed the unthinkable: the Democratic National Committee actively worked to undermine the Presidential campaign of Bernie Sanders in favor of the establishment choice in Hillary Clinton. Sanders never had a chance. Honest commentators called this an affront to the democratic process, while party insiders and Clinton supporters pretended to be aloof as if it never happened. 
To prove this point, both President Obama and Hillary Clinton then gave Wasserman-Schultz a glowing endorsement on the way out. ‚ÄúFor the last eight years, Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz has had my back. This afternoon, I called her to let her know that I am grateful,‚Äù said Obama. Not surprisingly, Clinton thanked Wasserman Schultz, presumably for helping to knock her only competitor Sanders out of the Democrat primary race. ‚ÄúI am grateful to Debbie for getting the Democratic Party to this year‚Äôs historic convention in Philadelphia, and I know that this week‚Äôs events will be a success thanks to her hard work and leadership,‚Äù said Clinton. 
The party had sold its soul to devil and no one seemed to care too much about it. 
Party Meltdown 
Wasserman Schultz‚Äôs replacement didn‚Äôt fair much better. DNC Vice Chairwoman Donna Brazile was installed to serve as interim chair through the remainder election, but Brazile was soon skewered by subsequent Wikileaks batches ‚Äì showing how, on more than one occasion, she fed debate questions obtained from corrupt mainstream media operatives ‚Äì straight to Hillary Clinton. 
‚Äú A March 12 email exchange shows Brazile stating that she received a town hall question from Roland Martin, a TV One host who co-moderated a March 13 town hall with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper.‚Äù 
‚Äú A March 5 email shows that she shared a question with Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications director Jennifer Palmieri that was to be asked in a March 6 debate hosted by CNN in Flint, Mich.‚Äù (Source: Daily Caller ) 
Brazile‚Äôs audacious fraud also helped contribute to her party‚Äôs planned sabotage of Democrat challenger Bernie Sanders. Watch Brazile go into full meltdown when confronted here: 
. Completely corrupt and still, Brazile even had to temerity to deny doing it when pressed on FOX News last week. Brazile‚Äôs reputation is so bad now that even CNN has severed ties with her ‚Äì and that‚Äôs saying a lot. 
In addition, it was also revealed how CNN‚Äôs head political commentator, Gloria Borger , was named by Podesta as one of a shortlist of ‚Äòjournalists‚Äô the Clinton campaign would ‚Äúwork with‚Äù to gain favorable coverage. You‚Äôd think that CNN would have dropped Borger after this was revealed, but no. Amazingly, Borger is still leading CNN‚Äôs election coverage. 
Clearly, CNN cannot be trusted to police itself when it comes to matters of outright collusion with Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Ever-unbiased CNN's Gloria Borger refers to being in ""GOP hell"" and says she'll ""reach out soon"" to Podesta. Heart-warming #PodestaEmails13 pic.twitter.com/CQFdcJ12Q5

Worse Than Watergate 
Perhaps a bigger scandal which the Obama White House and Clinton campaign operatives would like to bury ‚Äì is the FBI‚Äôs investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal confirmed the existence of an internal feud between the FBI and the Justice Department, over whether or not to pursue an investigation into Clinton issue: 
‚ÄúSome investigators grew frustrated, viewing FBI leadership as uninterested in probing the charity, these people said. Others involved disagreed sharply, defending FBI bosses and saying Mr. McCabe in particular was caught between an increasingly acrimonious fight for control between the Justice Department and FBI agents pursuing the Clinton Foundation case. It isn‚Äôt unusual for field agents to favor a more aggressive approach than supervisors and prosecutors think is merited. But the internal debates about the Clinton Foundation show the high stakes when such disagreements occur surrounding someone who is running for president.‚Äù 
There‚Äôs more. It was also revealed last week how Jill McCabe, the wife of FBI Deputy Director, Andrew McCabe , received $467,500 in campaign funds in late 2015 for her Virginia State Senate run. This unusually large donation came via a political action committee run by Virginia Gov.Terry McAuliffe ‚Äì a Clinton Foundation board member. After the funds were donated, Andrew McCabe was then put in charge of the Clinton Email case. In normal times, this one scandal would be bigger than Watergate, but these are not normal times . 
So why is Washington going all out to deflect to Russia , and cover-up the Clinton scandals, and the Wikileaks document dumps? One reason is because the Clinton email issue goes all the way to the top ‚Äì to the President himself. 
What 21WIRE reported on Oct 21st is how President Obama lied when first confronted about whether or not he knew about the existence of Hillary‚Äôs unauthorized private server. Obama told CBS News on March 7, 2015 that he only found out about Clinton‚Äôs server ‚Äúthe same time everybody else learned it through news reports.‚Äù The President‚Äôs lie was confirmed when newly released FBI documents showed that: 
‚ÄúObama used a pseudonym [bobama@ameritech.net] when communicating with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by email, and at least one of those emails ended up on Clinton‚Äôs private email server.‚Äù 
So, not only did Obama lie on national TV, but he also broke strict White House security protocols by carelessly exchanging private emails ‚Äúoff grid‚Äù with Hillary Clinton on a unsecured and unauthorized mail server ‚Äì maybe to avoid the same scrutiny one would have on a government system. Who knows why he did it. 
Sure, he‚Äôs not the first US President to lie, but like, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton, Obama just joined that exclusive liars club ‚Äì caught out lying to the American people. 
On top of this, any communications made by the President of the United States are de facto labeled as ‚Äú born classified .‚Äù The same goes for any State Department communications with other foreign ministers. 
COVER-UP: John Podesta and Huma Abedin on the Hillary campaign jet (Image: ABC News ) 
It should be well known by now after watching both Attorney Generals Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch in action ‚Äì that the Obama Justice Department (DOJ) is one of the most politicized in history. Bear that in mind when looking at the latest leg of the Hillary Email case. 
On Friday, FBI Director James Comey set the election alight after announcing that the FBI would be reopening the Clinton email case ‚Äì currently examining 650,000 emails found while investigating a laptop belonging to former US Congressman Anthony Weiner (estranged husband of top Clinton aid and long-time confidant Huma Abedin) who was snared in a ‚Äòsexting‚Äô scandal, allegedly involving a underaged female. So which DOJ person is in charge of this investigation? None other than Assistant Attorney General Peter J. Kadzik . Who is Kadzik? Zero Hedge reports: 
‚ÄúOh yes. Recall our post from last week, ‚Äú Clinton Campaign Chair Had Dinner With Top DOJ Official One Day After Hillary‚Äôs Benghazi Hearing ‚Äù in which we reported that John Podesta had dinner with one of the highest ranked DOJ officials the very day after Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Benghazi testimony? It was Peter Kadzik.‚Äù 
Oh, and if that wasn‚Äôt good enough, Kadzik was also Podesta‚Äôs lawyer back in 1998 when Ken Starr was investigating Podesta over his role in helping Bill Clinton intern/mistress Monica Lewinsky land a job at the United Nations. The two were described as ‚Äòbest friends.‚Äô FOX News confirms: 
‚ÄúFantastic lawyer. Kept me out of jail,‚Äù Podesta wrote on Sept. 8, 2008 to Obama aide Cassandra Butts, according to emails hacked from Podesta‚Äôs Gmail account and posted by WikiLeaks. 
To call the Clinton circle incestuous would be an understatement, and on the whole, Americans are sick of it. 
Russia ‚Äì The Party Scapegoat 
Former Democratic Party leader Howard Dean was so incensed about the FBI reopening the case, he accused the FBI director of being in league with Russia, Tweeting: ‚ÄúIronically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin.‚Äù Ironically Comey put himself on the same side as Putin. 
‚Äî Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) October 29, 2016 
Another veteran party operative and lifetime Clinton defender, James Carville , was so upset by the FBI announcement that he accused ‚Äúthe KGB‚Äù working with Republicans to ‚Äúhijack the election‚Äù during his wild rant on MSNBC . 
‚ÄúI think this an outrage and I think the fact that the KGB is involved in this election is an outrage and I think the American people ought to take their democracy back regardless of what the press wants to do and the excuses they want to make for Comey. That‚Äôs what I think,‚Äù said Carville. 
Maybe someone can remind Carville that there is no KGB , and that the Soviet Union actually dissolved in 1991. 
These are just a few scandals surrounding the Democratic Party and the Clinton campaign, along with the many expos√©s revealed through Wikileaks, and the Podesta email batches. Those are actual scandals with real tangible evidence ‚Äì unlike the ‚ÄòRussians hacking the DNC and John Podesta and passing those to Wikileaks.‚Äô 
Suffice to say, the Democratic Party machine has already demonstrated that it is prepared to say anything in order to deflect and divert attention away from the damning Wikileaks material, and also blame Donald Trump in the process. It should be obvious by now that in their desperation to push a highly comprised Hillary Clinton over the finish line on November 8th, the Washington establishment has concocted the story that ‚ÄòPutin is trying to influence our electoral process in the US.‚Äô They‚Äôve tried to lay this at the feet of Donald Trump, who Obama and Clinton claim has some secret special relationship with Vladimir Putin. The liberal mainstream media have made a meal out of this talking point, and anti-Russian war hawks on the Republican side love it too. For the White House and the Clinton campaign this seemed like the ultimate clean sweep ‚Äì a perfect double entendre . 
The geopolitical strategy behind this move was twofold. First, this non event would be used to advance immediate calls for sanctions against Russia. Secondly, the US could continue to lean on Russia in the UN over Syria. Previously, 21WIRE reported how Washington‚Äôs State Dept and UN delegations, led by the dynamic trio of John Kerry , Samantha Power , and John Kirby , already lied when levelling charges against Russia for war crimes in Aleppo, and again while accusing Russia and Syria of conducting an airstrike on a UN Aid Convoy in Syria. As we have already shown ‚Äì that raid was most likely a ground attack carried out of US-backed ‚Äòrebels‚Äô Al Nusra Front, or Nour al-Din al-Zenki. 
With so much at stake geopolitically, why would Washington lie about a potential World War III trigger event? If they are prepared to lie about this, what else are they prepared to lie about? 
The demonization of all things Russian has definitely accelerated since late 2013 when the US engineered a coup d‚Äôetat in Kiev, Ukraine. Ever since that it‚Äôs been a go-to talking point for ginning-up and new transaltlantic arms race, as with Republican war hawks ‚Äì and a convenient scapegoat for any politician requiring misdirection, like Clinton and the Democrats. When the new year rang in 2015, the newly appointed head of the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors, Andrew Lack, announced the new challenges facing America‚Äôs own state-run media arm that includes U.S. overseas propaganda assets including Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Middle East Broadcasting Networks and Radio Free Asia. Lack said , ‚ÄúWe are facing a number of challenges from entities like Russia Today which is out there pushing a point of view, the Islamic State in the Middle East and groups like Boko Haram,‚Äù He was forced to resign shortly after that. 
What‚Äôs clear is that when it comes to all things Russian, there is an established pattern of compulsive lying by this US Administration. The list is too long to chronicle here, although ‚Äò Russian-backed Rebles Shootting Down MH17 ,‚Äô and ‚Äò Assad Regime Sarin Attack in Damascus in 2013 ‚Äò certainly comes to mind. 
That said, it‚Äôs hard to imagine a lie as egregious and potentially destructive than one which accuses the Russia government, a world nuclear power and member of the UNSC, of ‚ÄòHacking Into the US Electoral Process.‚Äô When you examine history however, what you will find is plenty of evidence documenting exactly how the US government and the CIA have altered and flipped 100 foreign elections throughout history, the attempted assassination of over 50 foreign leaders . Knowing all this, one might find it hard to take seriously Washington‚Äôs claims that Putin and Trump are trying manipulate the 2016 Election 
On Oct 9, 2016, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov laid it all on the table: 
‚ÄúWe have witnessed a fundamental change of circumstances when it comes to the aggressive Russophobia that now lies at the heart of U.S. policy towards Russia. It‚Äôs not just a rhetorical Russophobia, but aggressive steps that really hurt our national interests and pose a threat to our security.‚Äù 
Self-serving, career political operatives in Washington are playing a dangerous game. History will mark this as one of the biggest political follies of the Obama-Clinton era. 
Knowing what we now know about the NSA and its ability to hack and grab any email or text message from anyone, anywhere ‚Äì if Washington really wanted to know where the hacks came from, maybe they could start there. Far be it from anyone in Washington or the media to ever adopt that line of inquiry. 
Still, we‚Äôre waiting for the emergence of an adult in the room in Washington ‚Äì before it‚Äôs too late.

Here is an article that looks at the real story behind one of the more interesting conspiracy theories about the 2016 election: 
Sometimes the real story is even more fascinating than any conspiracy theory. WeAreYourGods 
Wanna bet money that the Weiner laptop, on which the over 600,000 emails were stored in a folder titled ‚ÄúLife Insurance‚Äù, holds information linking the CF to human trafficking and typical elite pedophilia ‚Äúvacations‚Äù? Ever wonder why nobody ever really goes after the Clinton Foundation from a government office? Same old blackmail scheme involving underage sex slaves that was going on during the Boys Town scandal with Lawrence King and elite politicians and business people in the 80‚Äôs. Why would they stop?

Barrak Obama and Hillary Clinton are both political scam artists. It‚Äôs amazing that a US President would invent a Russian Hacking conspiracy theory in order to drive a geopolitical agenda. But then again, Bush did the same with Bin Laden and 9/11.

Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire 
The cozy relationship between Goldman Sachs and the Clintons has reached dizzying new heights in recent years, giving the Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton an immensely influential partner on Wall Street. 
As the public and most of the mainstream media is still processing the political bombshell concerning the newly reopened FBI probe into the Hillary Clinton ‚Äôs email server case ‚Äì the global investment banking firm Goldman Sachs quietly endorsed the Democratic presidential candidate this past week. 
The financial ties that bind the Clintons and Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs are nothing new, but never before have the connections been so exposed. Let‚Äôs take a trip down collusion lane to review some of the more questionable examples of their political and financial merger formed long ago‚Ä¶ 
‚ÄòMONEY CHANGERS‚Äô‚Äì Wall Street‚Äôs Goldman Sachs are inextricably linked to the Clinton‚Äôs and The Clinton Foundation. (Photo illustration 21WIRE) 
The Clintons & Goldman Sachs 
While campaigning for his first term in the White House, former president Bill Clinton received an enormous amount of support from Washington insider lobbyists and investment banking firms on Wall Street. 
At the top of the pile sat Goldman Sachs‚Ä¶ 
In 1992, the LA Times reported that presidential nominee Bill Clinton,‚Äù received the largest share of his financial support‚Äìat least $2.6 million‚Äìfrom lawyers and lobbyists,‚Äù and that Clinton also received additional support from ‚Äú‚Ä¶big securities firms such as Goldman, Sachs & Co. in New York and Stephens Inc. in his hometown of Little Rock, Ark. In fact, Goldman Sachs employees and their family members were responsible for the biggest contributions from a single firm: $98,700.‚Äù 
For decades the Clintons have remained close allies to the banking behemoth Goldman Sachs and in the process, a mutually beneficial relationship has taken hold, something that even the NY Times admits: 
‚ÄúOver 20-plus years, Goldman provided the Clintons with some of their most influential advisers, millions of dollars in campaign contributions and speaking fees, and financial support for the family foundation‚Äôs charitable programs.‚Äù 
By now, there should be little doubt that the Clinton political machine is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street banking cartel. Their relationship was built over three decades. 
The real watershed moment came here‚Ä¶ 
BLANK CHECK: Bill Clinton laughs with Wall Street elites after signing the Financial Services Modernization Act in 1999. 
‚ÄòKey to the Kingdom‚Äô 
In one of the most significant financial rulings in the modern era, the Clinton presidency gave big banks like Goldman Sachs the skeleton key to the kingdom by deregulating the investment banking system almost entirely. 
The Clinton/Goldman Sachs/Wall Street partnership was fully forged after the removal of the Glass-Steagall Act , which banking luminaries cynically named the ‚Äú Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999‚Ä≥ officially titled the Gramm- Leach-Bliley Act . The original Glass-Steagall was a depression-age four-part provision under the Bank Act of 1933 that strictly prohibited securities activities that could be harmful to investors ‚Äì the same sort of rogue speculating and paper fiat fraud which triggered the Great Depression (1929-1941). In fact, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which repealed Glass-Steagall, opened the door for the ‚Äòshadow banking‚Äô realm outside of regulatory oversight which led to a much higher trading risk, as banks became more interlinked. 
Simply put: Clinton‚Äôs repeal of Glass-Steagell removed the firewall between speculative investment banking and regular high street retail and consumer banking ‚Äì which exposed everyone to toxic, subprime ponzi schemes and fake paper products being pushed around the globe by the banking elite ‚Äì which ultimately causing the global economy to crash in 2008. All that can be laid at the feet of one William Jefferson Clinton. And Hillary still claims that, ‚ÄúMy husband did so well with the economy.‚Äù Really? 
In a cross-posted article featured at Huffington Post , Nomi Prins underscored the complicit nature of Wall Street and Washington after the removal of tighter bank regulations under the Clinton administration during the 1990‚Äôs: 
‚ÄúTo grasp the dangers that the Big Six banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) presently pose to the financial stability of our nation and the world, you need to understand their history in Washington, starting with the Clinton years of the 1990s. Alliances established then (not exclusively with Democrats, since bankers are bipartisan by nature) enabled these firms to become as politically powerful as they are today and to exert that power over an unprecedented amount of capital. Rest assured of one thing: their past and present CEOs will prove as critical in backing a Hillary Clinton presidency as they were in enabling her husband‚Äôs years in office.‚Äù 
Prins herself was a former managing director at Goldman Sachs, senior managing director at Bear Stearns, as well as having worked as a senior strategist at the now defunct investment banking firm Lehman Brothers. Following the financial crash in 2007-2008, Prins blew the whistle on the banking world in a book entitled ‚Äú It Takes a Pillage : Behind the Bonuses, Bailouts, and Backroom Deals from Washington to Wall Street.‚Äù 
Prins has become an advocate for the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act since departing from the investment banking world. 
The media outlet Common Dreams described the merger between Citicorp and Travelers Group (becoming Citigroup), which was dubbed the ‚ÄòCiti-Travelers Act‚Äô on Capitol Hill. It was a conglomeration that went hand in hand with the Clinton administration‚Äôs influence on banking deregulation marked by the repeal of Glass-Steagall: 
‚ÄúThen, in 1998, in an act of corporate civil disobedience, Citicorp and Travelers Group announced they were merging. Such a combination of banking and insurance companies was illegal under the Bank Holding Company Act , but was excused due to a loophole that provided a two-year review period of proposed mergers. The merger was premised on the expectation that Glass-Steagall would be repealed. Citigroup‚Äôs co-chairs Sandy Weill and John Reed led a swarm of industry executives and lobbyists who trammeled the halls of Congress to make sure a deal was cut.‚Äù 
At the time, it was the largest financial merger even though it was technically illegal , as stated by the former Bankers of America CEO Kenneth Guenther . In 1999 , after ‚Äú12 attempts in 25 years,‚Äù Congress passed the Financial Services Modernization Act , which led to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. 
The repeal of Glass-Steagall was pushed heavily by Citigroup‚Äôs co-CEO Sanford Weill and lobbyist Roger Levy and according to a report by The Nation : 
‚ÄúThey laid out more than $290 million for lobbying in 1998, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, and donated more than $150 million in the 1997‚Äì98 election cycle‚Äîa figure sure to be topped in 1999‚Äì2000.‚Äù 
How much of those contributions made their way to the Clinton family and what kind of impact did this have after they left the White House? 
In 2005, Bill Clinton was paid over half a million for speaking at three private Goldman events. 
In 2013, after stepping down from her position as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton gave a total of three paid speeches at Goldman Sachs events to the tune of $675,000 dollars, in which one attendee said ‚Äús he sounded more like a Goldman Sachs managing director,‚Äù according to a quote obtained by Politico . Indeed, Clinton gave a glowing speech to the Goldman gang and in the process, as Wikileaks released in early October , the Democratic nominee believes in ‚Äúboth a public and a private position‚Äù on Wall Street reform and that it is an ‚Äú oversimplification‚Äù to suggest that investment banking led to the most recent financial crisis. 
That Clinton leak provided another window into the much protected alliance between finance and politics, but it‚Äôs only the tip of a much larger iceberg. 
In 2015, the Washington Post reported that ‚ÄúHillary Rodham Clinton and former president Bill Clinton earned in excess of $25 million for delivering 104 speeches since the beginning of 2014, a huge infusion to their net worth as she was readying for a presidential bid.‚Äù 
‚ÄòANOINTED‚Äô: Chelsea Clinton with Goldman Sachs-backed hedge funder Marc Mezvinsky. 
The Clinton family is chock-full of banking connections, as Chelsea Clinton ‚Äòjoined‚Äô the Avenue Capital Group, which according to reports is a ‚Äú‚Ä¶$12 billion hedge fund whose founder has contributed to many Democratic Party campaigns.‚Äù Chelsea is married to Marc Mezvinsky , a former investment banker for Goldman Sachs. Chelsea‚Äôs tenure at Avenue Capital Group was from 2006-2008 just prior to Hillary Clinton‚Äôs run for president in 2008. Since then Chelsea has risen to vice chairman inside the Clinton Foundation. 
Marc Mezvinsky was forced to close one of his hedge funds recently, Eaglevale Hellenic Opportunity , after had the fund lost most of its initial investor funds of $25 million ‚Äì after blowing the money on secondhand junk Greek bank stocks and toxic government debt. 
The apple doesn‚Äôt fall far from the tree‚Ä¶ 
As it turns out, Marc is the son of troubled former Congressman Ed Mezvinsky ‚Äì another close friend of Team Clinton. 
Politico reports on one of Ed Mezvinsky‚Äôs financial controversies in 1999: 
‚ÄúIn the waning days of Clinton‚Äôs presidency, federal prosecutors and the FBI were bearing down on former Rep. Ed Mezvinsky (D-Iowa), who had fallen for a series of Ponzi schemes and pulled in nearly $10 million money from other investors to cover his losses. ‚Äú 
Continuing, Politico outlined new information concerning a pardon request sent by from Ed Mezvinsky‚Äôs wife to then President Bill Clinton: 
‚Äú‚Ä¶records released last week by the Clinton Presidential Library in Little Rock and obtained by POLITICO show Mezvinsky and his then-wife ‚Äî ex-Rep. Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky (D-Pa.) ‚Äî pleaded with the former president for a presidential pardon to head off the looming federal case.‚Äù 
In 2016, the Daily Mail reported the following: ‚ÄúChelsea Clinton‚Äôs husband and his partners have suffered a huge loss after trying to bet on the revival of the Greek economy, and are now being forced to shut down one of their hedge funds. Marc Mezvinsky, 38, and his partners, former Goldman Sachs colleagues Bennett Grau and Mark Mallon, raised $25million from investors to buy up bank stocks and debt from the struggling nation. That fund however has lost 90 percent of its value, investors with direct knowledge of the situation told The New York Times , and will now be closed.‚Äù

The NY Times further outlined the long-held Clinton/Goldman connection just two years before the 2007-2008 financial crisis: ‚ÄúThe Clintons‚Äô relationships with Wall Street deepened in the 2000s, when Mr. Clinton set up his foundation in Harlem and Mrs. Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York. That brought her in close touch with the big Wall Street firms, a source of jobs and tax revenue for New York ‚Äî and a leading source of campaign funds for Mrs. Clinton. During her years in Congress, employees of Goldman donated in excess of $234,000 to Mrs. Clinton, more than those of any other company except Citigroup, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Along with other New York politicians, Mrs. Clinton worked to obtain federal tax breaks to resuscitate Lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and those breaks helped Goldman build its new, roughly $2 billion headquarters. When it broke ground in 2005, Mrs. Clinton and other New York officials were on-site.‚Äù ‚ÄòHOW TO MONETIZE INFLUENCE‚Äô‚Äì Lloyd Blankfein at a Clinton Global Initiative event with Hillary Clinton. (Image Source: sputniknews ) The Wall Street Racket To understand who powers the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs billion dollar RICO influence-peddling slush fund, you need to understand how money is laundered between Wall Street and Washington DC. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citigroup and many others were all ordered to pay millions for misleading investors after the 2008 crash, then in April of 2016, Goldman was ordered to settle a federal and state probe for $5 Billion dollars. CNBC reported the following: 
‚ÄúGoldman Sachs will pay $5 billion to settle federal and state probes into the bank‚Äôs sale of mortgage-backed securities before the financial crisis, the Justice Department announced Monday. 
Authorities said Goldman misrepresented the quality of loans it securitized and then sold to investors ahead of the housing bubble and 2008 crisis. The settlement includes a $2.4 billion civil penalty, $1.8 billion in relief payouts to underwater homeowners and affected borrowers and $875 million to resolve various other claims. 
This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,‚Äù acting Associate Attorney General Stuart Delery said in a statement .‚Äù 
In 2013, a Bloomberg article questioned how Goldman managed to survive and even thrive during the 2007-2008 economic crisis: 
‚ÄúWhether Goldman could have gone the way of Lehman Brothers or Merrill Lynch remains the subject of much debate. Goldman maintains that it did not need, or want, the $10 billion bailout that Hank Paulson [ former Goldman alum] pushed on it and other firms in October 2008. But the fact remains that when the Federal Reserve allowed Goldman and Morgan Stanley‚Äîbut not Lehman Brothers‚Äîto become bank holding companies on Sept. 21, 2008, Goldman was able, three days later, to raise $10 billion in equity, $5 billion from the public and another $5 billion from investor Warren Buffett. That would probably not have happened without the Fed‚Äôs expedited decision and support. (A week later, Morgan Stanley saved itself from bankruptcy when it negotiated a $9 billion equity investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group.)‚Äù 
All told the Clinton friendly investment giant Goldman Sachs (after making record profits) became the fifth mega-bank ordered to pay billions to the Department of Justice after the financial crash of 2007-2008. In addition, the firm was ordered to pay $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency in 2014 ‚Äì not including pending private lawsuits levied on the firm since the Great Recession. 
In a New York Review article Goldman Sachs was already under investigation for committing fraud at least a year before the economic crash in 2007-2008: 
‚ÄúData gathered mostly from the Corporate Research Project , a public interest website, show that on thirteen occasions between 2009 and 2016, Goldman was penalized by US courts or government agencies for fraudulent or deceptive practices that were committed mostly between 2006 and 2009.‚Äù 
‚ÄòCASHING OUT‚Äô‚Äì Bill Clinton with his top economic strategist Robert Rubin. (Image Source: St. Louis Post-Dispatch ) 
Wall Street Selects ‚ÄòTeam Clinton‚Äô 
The Clinton connection to Goldman Sachs emerged in the early 1990‚Äôs as Robert Rubin , a former senior partner with Goldman (with a 26-year tenure with the firm), joined former President Clinton‚Äôs economic policy team, later becoming Secretary of the Treasury in 1995. Around that time, the Clinton presidency ushered in soaring tax hikes under the ‚ÄòRubinomics‚Äô banner (aka Clintonomics), the plan raised taxes on most Americans, specifically the middle class , in what was said to be the largest increase in American history at the time. 
According to Congressional record ( Vol.146 part 2 ), ‚ÄúIn 1995, the economy grew at a sickly 1.5% ‚Äì Clinton‚Äôs vetoes of spending cuts [insured] continued deficits well into the 21st Century.‚Äù 
In a Multinational Monitor report entitled ‚ÄúWall Street‚Äôs Best Investment: Ten Deregulatory Steps to Financial Meltdown,‚Äù by Robert Weissman and James Donahue , a clearer picture of the financial collusion spawned in the 1990‚Äôs under the Clinton administration was revealed: 
‚ÄúDuring the Clinton Administration, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had run Goldman Sachs, enthusiastically promoted the legislation. In a 1995 testimony before the House Banking Committee, for example, Rubin argued that ‚Äúthe banking industry is fundamentally different from what it was two decades ago, let alone in 1933. ‚Ä¶ U.S. banks generally engage in a broader range of securities activities abroad than is permitted domestically. Even domestically, the separation of investment banking and commercial banking envisioned by Glass-Steagall has eroded significantly.‚Äù 
With a pedigree that included Goldman Sachs, the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), The Brookings Institution and the Bilderberg Group , Robert Rubin emerged in 1999 as the vice chairman at Citigroup (1999-2009) after overseeing its merger as well as helping to craft the repeal of Glass-Steagall while serving as Secretary of Treasury. Rubin made a fortune with Citigroup causing sharp criticism in media and from those within the financial sector following the 2007-2008 crash. Here‚Äôs a passage from Bloomberg regarding Rubin in the aftermath of the banking collapse: 
‚ÄúWhen it collapsed, due in part to bank-friendly policies that Rubin advocated, he made more than $100 million while others lost everything. ‚ÄúYou have to view people in a fair light,‚Äù says Phil Angelides, co-chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, who credits Rubin for much of the Clinton-era prosperity. ‚ÄúBut on the other side of the ledger are key acts, such as the deregulation of derivatives, or stopping the Commodities Futures Trading Commission from regulating derivatives, that in the end weakened our financial system and exposed us to the risk of financial disaster.‚Äù

Under the Microscope 
Over the summer 21WIRE observed some curious connections between the Clinton Foundation and FBI director James Comey , as well as his questionable handling of other cases related to the Clinton family. Here‚Äôs the following passage to consider in light of the new information related to the Clinton investigation: 
‚ÄúMany will also be unaware that before Comey was installed by the Obama Administration as FBI Director, he was on the board of Director at HSBC Bank ‚Äì a bank implicated in international money laundering , including the laundering of billions on behalf of international drugs and narcotics trafficking cartels. Forbes also points out where Comey was also at the key choke-point during the case involving dodgy auditor KPMG which followed on by the HSBC criminal case: 
‚ÄúIf Comey, and his boss Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez, had made a different decision about KPMG back in 2005, KPMG would not have been around to miss all the illegal acts HSBC and Standard Chartered SCBFF +% were committing on its watch. Bloomberg reported in 2007 that back in June of 2005, Comey was the man thrust into the position of deciding whether KPMG would live or die for its criminal tax shelter violations.‚Äù 
In 2015, the Guardian discussed the financial relationship between HSBC and the Clinton Foundation receiving a startling $81 million in donations from clients of the large bank: 
‚ÄúThe charitable foundation run by Hillary Clinton and her family has received as much as $81m from wealthy international donors who were clients of HSBC‚Äôs controversial Swiss bank. 
Leaked files from HSBC‚Äôs Swiss banking division reveal the identities of seven donors to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation with accounts in Geneva.‚Äù 
A new update on the FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation was announced over the last 24 hours, in addition the recently reopened Clinton email probe from last week. It remains to be seen how in-depth this new investigation will be. 
To call it collusion would be an understatement. When looking back at the financial affairs of the Clintons, Goldman Sachs and others on Wall Street ‚Äì it‚Äôs clearer than ever that what we are looking at is a criminal syndicate.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
This should be the biggest revelation yet from WikiLeaks already epic email trove. Will the US media cover this story? 
Last night, in an RT Exclusive interview conducted by award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange described what he believes is ‚Äúthe most significant email in the whole collection.‚Äù 
WikiLeaks reveals an early 2014 email where the outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was urging John Podesta , then advisor to President Barack Obama, to ‚Äúbring pressure‚Äù on Gulf states Saudi Arabia and Qatar, ‚Äúwhich are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL [Islamic State, IS, ISIS] and other radical Sunni groups.‚Äù 
This constitutes proof that the Clinton Foundation knowingly accepting millions of dollars in ‚Äòcharitable‚Äô donations from the same Gulf states which both Secretary Clinton and President Obama knew were funding ISIS, Al Nusra Front (al Qaeda in Syria) and known takfiri terrorist fighting organizations. 
In addition, the Clinton‚Äôs Foundation took money from a number of other gulf monarchies: 
(Infographic: Conservative Post ) 
This latest news validates what 21WIRE has been saying since the ‚ÄòISIS crisis‚Äô began in June 2014. 
According to FOX News , FBI sources have said that ‚Äòindictments are likely‚Äô for the Clinton Foundation investigation. One only wonders how this latest Assange revelation will factor into the wider investigation ‚Äì as it goes right to the heart of the national security and foreign policy ‚Äì two things which Clinton trades heavily on in her campaigning. 
Assange went on to explain the deep ramifications of this latest criminal allegation against Clinton and her family foundation: 
‚ÄúAll serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some ‚Äúrogue‚Äù princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.‚Äù 
During their 25-minute interview filmed at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, Assange and Pilger discussed the obvious conflict of interest between Clinton as Secretary of State, the Clinton Foundation and Gulf monarchies who financed them. The following is an excerpt from the interview transcript: 
John Pilger: The Saudis, the Qataris, the Moroccans, the Bahrainis, particularly the first two, are giving all this money to the Clinton Foundation, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state, and the State Department is approving massive arms sales, particularly Saudi Arabia. 
Julian Assange: Under Hillary Clinton ‚Äì and the Clinton emails reveal a significant discussion of it ‚Äì the biggest-ever arms deal in the world was made with Saudi Arabia: more than $80 billion. During her tenure, the total arms exports from the US doubled in dollar value. 
JP: Of course, the consequence of that is that this notorious jihadist group, called ISIL or ISIS, is created largely with money from people who are giving money to the Clinton Foundation? 
JA: Yes.

The interview will air in full on RT International this Saturday Nov 5th.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Yesterday, WikiLeaks editor and founder Julian Assange confirmed what 21WIRE already knew ‚Äì that Hillary Clinton and the Obama White House‚Äôs claim of the US election process being ‚Äúhacked by the Russian government‚Äù was a desperate work of fiction. Not content with that fish tale, Hillary Clinton took the narrative to an embarrassing new low (if that was even possible) with another, wilder made-up conspiracy story about the Russians. 
The following statement made by Hillary Clinton yesterday epitomizes the term ‚Äú jumping the shark ‚Äú: It's time for Trump to answer serious questions about his ties to Russia. https://t.co/D8oSmyVAR4 pic.twitter.com/07dRyEmPjX 
‚Äî Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 31, 2016 
Apparently, Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign staff fed her a planted online news story (by the Clinton campaign?) which ran on a questionable pro-Democratic Party online news outlet. On Monday, the Slate ran the story by one of its alleged ‚Äújournalists‚Äù named Franklin Foer , complete with a clickbait blog-like headline, ‚ÄúWas a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?‚Äù 
Whatever legitimacy the Slate had before last night, just evaporated. 
John Roberts from Forbes explains, ‚ÄúThe bottom line is that Slate screwed up by publishing this in the first place, and by adding more kooky misinformation to an already addled election season. As for Foer, he says on Twitter a ‚Äúfollow up‚Äù piece is in the works.‚Äù 
Roberts rightly points out that the only follow-up story for this lemon should start with the word ‚ÄúRETRACTION.‚Äù 
CYBER FEUD: Assange believes Clinton has gone beyond the pale with her Russian conspiracy obsession. 
During his exclusive interview with award-winning filmmaker John Pilger, when asked what he thought of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs shrill antics, Julian Assange said, ‚Äú ‚ÄúI actually feel quite sorry for Hillary Clinton as a person, because I see someone who is eaten alive by their ambitions, tormented literally to the point where they become sick.‚Äù 
The saddest thing about this and the other dishonest and destructive actions of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party ‚Äì is that no one in the party seems to see anything wrong with this level of deceit and dishonesty. Like Hillary Clinton in her sociopathic path to power, the party rank and file are acting like a cult coven following their high priestess. 
Still, Clinton surrogates in the media are trying to equate Clinton simultaneously scapegoating and baiting another nuclear superpower ‚Äì with a decade-old misogynist hot mic audio excerpt of Donald Trump in a TMZ-style tabloid sting. That pretty much sums up Democratic Party strategy for this election season. 
Assange was right. Clinton, the Democratic Party and their surrogate, are eating themselves. Such are the spoils of power in Washington that men and women will do and say anything to have it.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Over the past months, Hillary Clinton, the Obama White House and the mainstream media have been promoting the conspiracy theory that ‚Äú Russia is Hacking the US Election ‚Äù‚Äì blaming Moscow for the WikiLeaks emails, the DNC Leaks and for allegedly ‚Äòhacking‚Äô US voting systems. Despite the grand accusations, no evidence or proof has been offered by the US government. 
It goes without saying how damaging the Democratic Party‚Äôs crazed witch hunt has been to US-Russian relations, where Clinton has led the anti-Russian crusade, and demonizing president Vladimir Putin at every opportunity. 
Today‚Äôs stunning presidential victory by Donald Trump means that all eyes are now on Putin to see how Moscow and Washington will be interfacing going forward. 
With such sensitive geopolitical issues like Syria and the Ukraine currently in play, what happens between the two leaders over the coming months could set the tone going forward‚Ä¶ 
In a message to Donald Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin has expressed confidence that the dialogue between Moscow and Washington, in keeping with each other‚Äôs views, meets the interests of both Russia and the US. 
Putin also expressed hope over the joint efforts on bringing Russian-American relations out of their current crisis. 
The Russian leader noted in the message that he hopes to address some ‚Äúburning issues that are currently on the international agenda, and search for effective responses to the challenges of the global security,‚Äù RIA Novosti reported. 
On top of it, Putin has expressed confidence that ‚Äúbuilding a constructive dialogue between Moscow and Washington, based on principles of equality, mutual respect and each other‚Äôs positions, meets the interests of the peoples of our countries and of the entire international community.‚Äù 
According to many observers, US-Russia relations are now at their lowest point since the Cold War. Putin has repeatedly noted that the worsening of Russia‚Äôs relations with the US ‚Äúwas not our choice,‚Äù however. 
For things to improve between Moscow and Washington, the US should first and foremost start acting like an equal partner and respect Russia‚Äôs interests rather than try to dictate terms, Putin said last month. 
‚ÄúWe are concerned with the deterioration of Russian-American relations, but that was not our choice, we never wanted that. On the contrary, we want to have friendly relations with the US, a great country and a leading economy,‚Äù Putin said at an economic forum in Moscow‚Ä¶

One of the great myths being spun by the establishment media was that Donald Trump had no support from women, latinos and blacks in the US. As it turned out, this was a lie propagated in a failed attempt to margnalize Republican voters and give a false impression of a liberal Democratic mandate in America. In the end Trump gathered 29% of Latinos, 9% of African Americans and 49% of college educated white women. For months, mainstream media pundits and polls insisted that all of these demographics were exclusively for Hillary Clinton. How could they have got it so wrong? 
Psychologist and intenet radio personality Kiki Green explains how blacks were conned into voting for Hillary Clinton by the partnership between the Democratic Party, Hollywood and the Clinton campaign ‚Äì by cynically using celebrities like Beyonce, Jay Z and Katie Perry‚Ä¶

Shawn Helton 21st Century Wire 
Anti-Trump street protests linked to the Soros‚Äô funded organization MoveOn.org have cascaded across the nation for the third day following the 2016 presidential election result. 
Mainstream media outlets like CNN and MSNBC have given the protests around-the-clock media coverage, drowning out all other news stories, including a successful transition meeting between the President Elect and President Barack Obama. 
‚ÄòOUTSIDER VS. INSIDER‚Äô‚Äì Manufactured social unrest incited after announcement of Trump presidency. (Photo Illustration 21WIRE‚Äôs Shawn Helton) 
The Free Thought Project weighed in on the new developments concerning a series of centrally coordinated anti-Trump protests organized in part by by the George Soros NGO MoveOn: 
‚ÄúWashington, D.C. ‚Äì Billionaire globalist financier George Soros‚Äô MoveOn.org has been revealed to be a driving force behind the organizing of nationwide protests against the election of Donald Trump ‚Äî exposing the protests to largely be an organized, top-down operation ‚Äî and not an organic movement of concerned Americans taking to the streets as reported by the mainstream media. 
Wednesday saw protests in the streets of at least 10 major U.S. cities. Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., Portland, Ore., St. Paul, Minn., Seattle , and several other cities saw protests, according to USA Today. 
In light of the protests and rioting that have transpired since the election of Trump, a closer analysis of the dynamic at play is warranted to gauge whether it‚Äôs an organic grassroots movement, or something much more organized, sophisticated and potentially dangerous.‚Äù 
Soros‚Äô affiliated organization MoveOn.org released the following press release yesterday afternoon: 
‚ÄúAmericans to Come Together in Hundreds Peaceful Gatherings of Solidarity, Resistance, and Resolve Following Election Results 
Hundreds of Americans, dozens of organizations to gather peacefully outside the White House and in cities and towns nationwide to take a continued stand against misogyny, racism, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. 
Tonight, thousands of Americans will come together at hundreds of peaceful gatherings in cities and towns across the nation, including outside the White House, following the results of Tuesday‚Äôs presidential election. 
The gatherings ‚Äì organized by MoveOn.org and allies ‚Äì will affirm a continued rejection of Donald Trump‚Äôs bigotry, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and misogyny and demonstrate our resolve to fight together for the America we still believe is possible. 
Within two hours of the call-to-action, MoveOn members had created more than 200 gatherings nationwide, with the number continuing to grow on Wednesday afternoon.‚Äù 
Soros Agit-Prop Empire 
Last year during the ongoing European migrant crisis, startling claims were levied by Hungarian PM Victor Orban (left photo), concerning the role played by Soros. 
PM Orban contended that the founder and chair of Open Society Foundations (Open Society Institute), was entrenched in a ‚Äú circle of activists,‚Äù that ‚Äúinadvertently become part of this international human-smuggling network.‚Äù 
The stunning declaration by Orban recalled the misguided machinations of ‚ÄòThe Occupy Movement‚Äô ( aka OWS) in 2011, as well as the Soros funded protests in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, along with other Black Lives Matter protests this past year ‚Äì all of which were uniquely designed to push naive participants (along with paid provocateurs) into violent action and social unrest. 
Back in January, MoveOn publicly endorsed the Bernie Sanders campaign in what appeared to be a call to action for BLM associated groups seen backing Sanders. It‚Äôs worth mentioning, that MoveOn also supported the Obama campaign in 2008 and according to the website, Sanders was the only other candidate to reach the ‚Äúthreshold for an endorsement.‚Äù 
As we said back in March, professional political agitator flash mobs, had been mobilized at future Trump campaign events, making it very difficult to run a normal campaign ‚Äì as ‚Äòactivists‚Äô attempted to take away Trump‚Äôs ‚Äòstrength in numbers‚Äô at his rallies. This was confirmed at events in both Ohio, and at a Trump primary campaign event the University of Illinois Chicago earlier this year, where hundreds of BLM activists and Sanders supporters, triggered voilent clashes inside the venue and even stormed the stage , shortly after Trump started speaking, then again at Reno he was birddogged just prior to his election forcing secret service to escort Trump away. 
In a Politico article in early 2016 entitled ‚Äú Major donors consider funding Black Lives Matter ,‚Äù we gained deeper insight into the political funding for BLM and the Soros linked Democratic Alliance: 
‚ÄúMajor donors are usually not as radical or confrontational as activists most in touch with the pain of oppression,‚Äù said Steve Phillips, a Democracy Alliance member and significant contributor to Democratic candidates and causes. He donated to a St. Louis nonprofit group called the Organization for Black Struggle that helped organize 2014 Black Lives Matter-related protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the police killing of a black teenager named Michael Brown. And Phillips and his wife, Democracy Alliance board member Susan Sandler, are in discussions about funding other groups involved in the movement.‚Äù 
It worth noting how Soros, a long time contributor to Hillary Clinton, donated $2 million in PAC money in 2015 and January of 2016, Soros reportedly gave $8 million to ‚Äúboost‚Äù Clinton‚Äôs campaign . Soros also recently funded $15 million to Latino groups looking to stop Trump‚Äôs rise towards a potential GOP nomination and beyond. 
Look for these political engineers to pit choreographed conservative and liberal groups against each other across the country ‚Äì as all of these hostile uprisings are designer engineered by party linked alliances. 
‚ÄòSOCIAL ENGINEERING‚Äô‚Äì Political memes and staged political flash mobs have been sparked by media, NGO‚Äôs and social media. (Image Source: abc news ) 
During the last month, it was revealed how investigative non-profit Project Veritas found evidence that the DNC paid participants to incite violence at Trump rallies during the course of the 2016 election. 
If those reports are accurate ‚Äì reports which have gone unchallenged so far ‚Äì this would be in violation of both election bylaws and also US criminal law.

USA Color Revolutions 
Both the purpose of these types of agitation activities seems to be to first cause a public disruption, and also to foment are a form of modern class warfare. These political protests are designed in such a way as to disguise its true intentions. Ultimately, a radical globalist and cultural marxist ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù agenda is at play ‚Äì eroding the legitimacy of a democratically elected government through a series of artificial ‚Äòcolor‚Äô upheavals, and where possible ‚Äì weakening a country‚Äôs national sovereignty through forced dependency on multilateral globalist institutions like the UN or IMF, while presenting shock and awe imagery in order to manipulate the public‚Äôs political perspective. 
This is how the US and its CIA conduct their destablization ‚Äòcolor revolution‚Äô campaigns overseas , and now astute observers will be able to see these exact same methods being deployed here inside the US. 
Overseas, Washington tends to use the same cast of NGO fronts to build-up pro-US political opposition groups, as well as plan and generate civil unrest. They include the Albert Einstein Institute (AEI), National Endowment for Democracy (NED), International Republican Institute (IRI), National Democratic Institute (NDI), Freedom House and later the International Center for Non-Violent Conflict (ICNC), and the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the financial and contractor arm of the Department of State. 
Inside the US, deep state actors in Washington generally work through Democratic Party affiliated organizations like MoveOn.org , as well as through labor union organizations like AFL-CIO , and UNITE HERE . These, along with many other similar organizations have been involved in organizing this week‚Äôs protests. 
It still remains to be seen if Trump‚Äôs stated dynamic political vision for America can unite an embattled nation by restoring international relations throughout the world, in addition to helping economic woes at home, or will it simply push the country further into authoritarianism. This remains to be seen. 
Certainly, judging by President Obama and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs total silence over their own party‚Äôs role in fomenting this week‚Äôs unrest ‚Äì one can only conclude that both party leaders approve of the protests and riots. The political motivation is undeniable ‚Äì to help delegitimize a new Trump presidency. 
But one thing is for sure ‚Äì there‚Äôs no doubt now that a systematic design is in place to unsettle the 45th president and the public should question why. 
Legal Action Against Soros Groups 
In a recent report featured at RT news we learn that George Soros and BLM activists will be sued for the deaths of slain police officers in Dallas and Baton Rouge: ‚ÄúThe father of the Dallas police officer who was killed by a lone gunman during a Black Lives Matter protest is suing the organization‚Äôs activists and George Soros for $550 million . In a separate suit a Baton Rouge police officer is suing for injuries sustained during a BLM protest. 
The father of Patrick Zamarripa filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and other groups for allegedly ‚Äúinciting a war on police‚Äù that led to the death of his son. 
The lawsuit filed in US District Court in Dallas on Monday seeks $550 million in damages. 
‚ÄúWhile Defendant Black Lives Matter claims to combat anti-black racism,‚Äù the lawsuit said, according to the Fort Worth Star Telegram, ‚Äúthe movement has in fact incited and committed further violence, severe bodily injury and death against police officers of all races and ethnicities, Jews, and Caucasians. Defendant Black Lives Matter is in fact a violent and revolutionary criminal gang.‚Äù 
The misguided machinations behind the anti-Trump protests have dominated any peaceful transition into power for the president-elect. Will these protest groups be a reboot of the OWS movement, occupying the masses with their own hateful rhetoric as we move into 2017 and beyond?

George Soros begins his color revolution in America, as MoveOn ‚Äúactivists‚Äù march against Trump 
By Alex Christoforou The Duran 
Anti-Trump protesters march through the streets of New York shouting ‚ÄòNot my president‚Äô. 
MoveOn.org is a George Soros NGO‚Ä¶and George Soros NGOs have nothing to do with charity or justice, and everything to do with political leverage, and in extreme cases government insurrection. 
We have seen Soros begin destructive movements to remove those he deems unsuitable to govern in a variety of countries, most recently in Ukraine, with the Soros sponsored Maidan coup. 
Now it looks like Soros may be setting his sights on sabotaging the forthcoming Trump presidency. 
We do know, thanks to Wikileaks, that George Soros was a huge supporter of Hillary Clinton, as Hillary Clinton was always looking out of George Soros‚Äô best interests. 
We are certain Trump‚Äôs victory is a bitter pill for globalist Soros to swallow. Between Putin and Trump, Soros may finally be starting to feel his power on the world stage falter.

Organized efforts are underway by Democratic Party affiliated NGO‚Äôs to try and somehow delegitimize the results of this week‚Äôs US Presidential Election. 
On the eve of the US Election before voters went to the polls, 21WIRE political affairs analyst Patrick Henningsen accurately predicted this week‚Äôs unrest when he said : 
‚ÄúIf Trump wins, expect the likes of Soros and MoveOn.org to unleash wave after wave of flash mobs, who will protest, riot, smash and burn their way on to CNN‚Äôs 24 hour news rotation. Expect Occupy 2.0, and #BlackLivesMatter to rage.‚Äù 
On Friday, Henningsen talked to RT International about the post-elections protests that were coordinated in part by Democratic Party ‚Äòcommunity organizing‚Äô online platform MoveOn.org . Watch: 
. Not surprisingly, MoveOn.org have also launched a national ‚Äòactivist‚Äô campaign to ‚Äú Abolish the Electoral College ‚Äù after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton came up short with 232 (including New Hampshire) to Donald Trump‚Äôs 306 (including Arizona and Michigan). Final totals are not yet in, but thus far 2016 would be the fifth time in U.S. history that a presidential candidate has won the White House while losing the total popular vote.

You can imagine how nations like China and Russia are now laughing at US students as mass psychological trauma has apparently set-in across liberal America. Schools, universities and political institutions across the country are now offering various services following Republican Donald Trump‚Äôs insurgent victory in the US presidential election. 
According to NBC News , Democratic staffers were so distraught over this week‚Äôs election that ‚Äútherapy dogs‚Äù had to be brought in to help workers on Capitol Hill cope with their vulnerabilities and hurt feelings.

Therapy Dogs included two golden doodles, two American Eskimo dogs, and a beagle mix ‚Äì walked around the offices of the House of Representatives. Students at Cornell University even staged a ‚Äúcry-in‚Äù on campus the day after the election. 
Other US campuses were organizing various theraputic activities like poetry readings, where ‚Äúhealthy snacks will be served.‚Äù 
The dogs were organized by NGOs the Human Animal Bond Research Initiative, Pet Partners, the Pet Leadership Council and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council. 
Their press release says that Democratic Party staffers needed, ‚Äúthe help of a non-judgmental, furry, four-legged best friend that enjoys bipartisan support.‚Äù 
‚ÄúOrganizers say it was a great way for workers to blow off steam especially for those whose bosses may have lost re-election bids,‚Äù NBC added. 
Also,‚Äúcry-ins‚Äù were staged on the campus of Cornell University, and Yale University even staged a ‚Äúgroup scream‚Äù in order to help student vent their ‚Äúinternalized stress‚Äù the day after the election.

J.R. Smith 21st Century Wire 
The election campaign might be over, but the mainstream media‚Äôs campaign against President Elect Donald Trump is in full swing. 
Between all of the fake polling, intentionally pro-Clinton partisan coverage, and mainstream media collusion with the Democratic National Party and the Clinton Campaign exposed through WikiLeaks‚Äô Podesta email dump ‚Äì nearly the entire US mainstream media is now in full damage-limitation mode desperately trying to preserve any crumb of credibility and perceived authority they might have left. 
It‚Äôs now become clear that the media is guilty on multiple fronts, as more proof has emerged of how they are helping to stoke violence, while promoting unfounded fears ‚Äì and all the while pushing fictional ‚Äòhate crime‚Äô hoaxes. 
CBS News flagship investigative program 60 Minutes conducted a recorded interview with Trump on Friday in which he made a direct plea on camera to any possible supporters to ‚ÄúStop it,‚Äù in reference to anyone that may have written racist slogans or abusive language in public, or at schools. In light of the numerous pockets of protests and outbreaks of partisan violence which have racked America since the election results were announced last week, it would have been in the public interest to release this powerful appeal by Trump, but instead mainstream CBS buried it for 3 days until 60 Minutes was scheduled to air later on Sunday evening nationwide. If CBS had any credibility remaining, this certainly will have finished it off. 
When told about alleged reports of a ‚ÄòTrump supporter‚Äô who were said to have been harassing Latinos and Muslims following his presidential win, Trump told interviewer Leslie Stahl , ‚ÄúI am so saddened to hear that.‚Äù He then added, ‚ÄúAnd I say, ‚ÄòStop it.‚Äô If it helps, I will say this ‚Äì and I will say right to the cameras: ‚ÄòStop it.'‚Äù 
One big thing in this incident that many mainstream media observers did not pick up is that at no time did Stahl give any specifics on these alleged ‚Äúabuses‚Äù by Trump supporters against Muslims and Latinos, and even though it‚Äôs obvious that Trump was not responsible for directing any alleged abuses ‚Äì Stahl still demanded an apology on their behalf ‚Äì without offering any evidence to support her claim. This was ‚Äòdrive-by‚Äô media at its worst. In fact, not one of these said accusations of abuse have been properly investigated by the media, and some may end up actually being media-generated rumors, or even hoaxes. 
Now, it‚Äôs perfectly understandable that Trump‚Äôs victory over the establishment‚Äôs heavily inflated candidate Hillary Clinton has left many Democrats, especially millennial college-aged students upset, angry and feeling more than a little delicate due to their bruised collective egos (they are not upset that Trump won, as much as they are upset that ‚Äòthey‚Äô lost). The real problem exists far beyond the learned immaturity of America‚Äôs politically correct-obsessed young adults. The real danger is that Democratic Party gutter operatives and their liberal media cohorts are actually staging, and fabricating ‚Äúhate crime‚Äù incidents in order to propagate the idea that the President Elect and his supporters are somehow ‚Äúcausing many minorities fearful about the future‚Äù. In reality, much of this hype is being generated through these same liberal media outlets. 
In fact, one Muslim female from Louisiana has since been forced to apologize for inventing her alleged ‚Äòhate crime‚Äô incident ‚Äì one designed to discredit Trump, and to help stoke more nationwide protests. 
Buzzfeed reported, via Religion of Peace : 
A woman who claimed she was attacked and robbed by two men near the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, including one wearing a Donald Trump hat, made up the story, police said in a statement. 
The woman had alleged the men yelled obscenities at her and took away her wallet and hijab, a scarf sometimes worn by Muslim women, The Advertiser reported. 
Lafayette Police officials said in a statement the incident is no longer under investigation, the paper reported. 
‚ÄúDuring the course of the investigation, the female complainant admitted that she fabricated the story about her physical attack as well as the removal of her hijab and wallet by two white males,‚Äù the statement reportedly read. 
NOTE: This story made national headlines and was not questioned or challenged by the hordes of self-described ‚Äújournalists‚Äù who populate the news and editorial newsrooms of America‚Äôs corrupt liberal mainstream media. 
That‚Äôs right ‚Äì this was just another hoax: 
Violent Democratic-Affiliated Street Gangs 
What Leslie Stahl and the rest of the gatekeepers at CBS and 60 Minutes have obscured is the fact since Tuesday‚Äôs election, nearly all of the so-called ‚Äòviolent hate crimes‚Äô have been carried out against Trump supporters ‚Äì by street gangs who are most clearly Democrat Party supporters. 
Here are just a few examples: @michellemalkin Even high school kids are not spared. Student Trump supporter attacked at Woodside High School https://t.co/e7tVvDJ6O8 
‚Äî Mama Angel (@Mommysaurus75) November 11, 2016 
Watch this clip taken from the radical leftist Portland protests this weekend, where Democratic Party supports attack a single woman in her car because they believed that she was a ‚ÄòTrump supporter.‚Äô These violent incidents reveal the flavor of anarchy which the Democratic Party and the sitting President of the United States, Barack Obama ‚Äì are condoning through their deaf silence over the multiple reports of street violence unleashed with the help of the Democratic Party‚Äôs online ‚Äòcommunity organizer‚Äô network MoveOn.org ‚Äì a digital platform partly funded by leading Clinton donor and billionaire George Soros . Watch this stunning clip: 
. Here is a video of clip of a white male in Chicago, 49 yr old David Wilcox, who was driving and scraped another vehicle. When the two parties stopped at the intersection to exchange insurance information, Wilcox was greeted by a gang of African-Americans, presumably Democratic Party supporters, who began pointing and shouting, ‚ÄúYou voted for Donald Trump!‚Äù before beating and robbing the man in the middle of the street. Wilcox was then dragged hundreds of yards as he tried to keep the gang from stealing his car in broad daylight. He was treated for multiple wounds at a local hospital. 
From reports we learned that at no time before the attack took place did Wilcox display any support for Donald Trump. It appears as if they attacked him because he was white. So could one call this a case of black on white racism? Regardless, it‚Äôs political intimidation done on the street ‚Äì which could also be defined as pure political fascism. In this instance, the violence was partisan, and carried out by what could be classed as unofficial Democrat foot soldiers ‚Äì enforcing a type of radical political regime on the streets of America. Watch this disturbing video: . Agitator and Chief: Where is Obama? 
These incidents have been mostly blacked out by a national US media who are obviously still working to discredit the Trump Presidency. 
Amidst all this violence, however, where is the current President Obama, or the Democratic Party‚Äôs losing candidate Hillary Clinton ‚Äì to help calm street thugs and violent ‚Äòprogressives‚Äô? It‚Äôs almost as if Obama and Clinton are enjoying the unrest. Most certainly though, Obama, Clinton and the Democratic Party are hoping to use this week‚Äôs media-generated liberal angst as future political leverage. 
What used to be regarded as a reputable investigative news program, 60 minutes, has gradually become a joke. It seems disinterested in covering anything of genuine interest, opting instead for running bland People Magazine and Time Magazine-style ‚Äòsafe‚Äô segments. Judging by its plummeting ratings, and its predictable cast of ‚Äòjob for life‚Äô government-approved media gatekeeper-cum-commentators like Anderson Cooper and Lesley Stahl, there is little hope for this institution. You might even say it‚Äôs irredeemable . 
One of the corporate mainstream‚Äôs worst offenders during the election was CNN host Brian Stelter (photo, left), whose own show is ironically titled ‚ÄúReliable Sources.‚Äù Stelter is meant to be CNN‚Äôs media watchdog person, laughably given the lofty title as ‚Äúsenior media analyst.‚Äù After leading CNN‚Äôs own exposed efforts to obscure and derail Trump‚Äôs Presidential run, while working to cover for a hugely unpopular (even among Democrats) Hillary Clinton candidacy, Stelter has now taken it upon himself to revamp his network‚Äôs horrible reputation as an establishment gatekeeper and manipulator of US elections. But it‚Äôs too late. The damage has already been done, and CNN will not regain the hanging facade of credibility it once struggled to retain. They are a dirty media outlet, and now everyone knows it. 
Now CBS News has been exposed in public view, but their crime is even worse than CNN‚Äôs which was just dirty politics in comparison. CBS News took it upon itself to compromise public safety, and put lives at risk ‚Äì all for its own selfish institutional political position. Twenty years ago, this might have been considered shameful, but in today‚Äôs toxic liberal media establishment ruled by an unhealthy feeling of superiority over the unwashed masses ‚Äì they are all way past shameless at this stage. 
None of them can be trusted anymore ‚Äì only tolerated, in the hope that they might actually report some useful news in the coming years.

COSMETIC: CBS‚Äôs Stahl represents the shallow, bland irrelevance of the mainstream gatekeeping media. 
Joe Concha The Hill 
CBS News is under fire for holding a videotaped clip from a Friday interview with President-elect Donald Trump urging supporters not to attack minorities until a ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù broadcast on Sunday night. 
‚ÄúI am very surprised to hear that. I hate to hear it,‚Äù Trump told interviewer Lesley Stahl when told of some attacks on minorities that have reportedly occurred since his election victory Tuesday. 
‚ÄúI am so sorry to hear it, and I say stop it,‚Äù Trump said before looking directly into the camera. ‚ÄúAnd I say right to the camera, stop it.‚Äù 
‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù did release quotes from the Friday interview in advance, but only a statement by Trump on the Affordable Care Act. 
‚ÄúWe chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare,‚Äù a spokesperson for CBS told CNN Monday. 
Kai Ryssdal, host of ‚ÄúMarketplace,‚Äù called that reasoning ‚Äúcompletely underwhelming.‚Äù CBS's underwhelming answer: ""We chose to release a quote on the issue that affects the most Americans & that was his statement on Obamacare""

William McGurn Wall Street Journal 
Let‚Äôs get this straight. Calling Hillary Clinton a ‚Äúbigot‚Äù has reporters asking every Republican in sight if Donald Trump has gone too far. But the Clinton campaign releases a video saying Mr. Trump is the candidate of the Ku Klux Klan, and it‚Äôs all okey-dokey? 
Then again, Mr. Trump has already been likened to Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. Small wonder there‚Äôs a collective ho-hum when Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine says Mr. Trump is peddling ‚ÄúKKK values.‚Äù 
This is what Democrats do. It didn‚Äôt start with Mr. Trump, either. For years Democrats have portrayed the GOP as one giant hate group. 
Each presidential election, the drill goes like this: 
After Republicans nominate someone, he immediately finds himself having to prove he‚Äôs not a hater ‚Äì of African-Americans, of women, of gays, etc. 
This year Democrats added a twist. Mr. Trump, they claim, represents a break with all those decent and lovable Republicans such as Mitt Romney , John McCain and George W. Bush . Of course, this isn‚Äôt what they were saying back when these men were running for president. 
‚Ä¢ In 2000, for example, an NAACP ad recreated the gruesome murder of James Byrd to imply that then-Gov. Bush was sympathetic to lynching black men. Over footage of a chain being dragged by a pickup truck, Mr. Byrd‚Äôs daughter says, ‚ÄúSo when Gov. George W. Bush refused to support hate-crimes legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again.‚Äù 
‚Ä¢ When John McCain ran in 2008, Barack Obama warned that Republicans would scare people by saying, ‚ÄúYou know, he doesn‚Äôt look like all those other presidents on those dollar bills.‚Äù The McCain campaign fired back, accusing Mr. Obama of playing the race card from the ‚Äúbottom of the deck.‚Äù Funny thing: All those reporters always hearing ‚Äúdog whistles‚Äù from Republicans somehow didn‚Äôt hear this one. 
‚Ä¢ In 2012, when Mitt Romney went to the NAACP and told them face-to-face about his opposition to ObamaCare, the stories were all about how he was really just trolling for the racist vote. Vice President Joe Biden put it more explicitly, telling a largely African-American audience that if Mr. Romney were to win, he‚Äôd ‚Äúput ya‚Äôll back in chains.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe person who received the most votes free from interference or tampering needs to be in the White House. It may well be Donald J. Trump, but further due diligence is required to ensure that American democracy is not threatened.‚Äù 
21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
Although the election was called on Nov 8th, the Democratic Party‚Äôs ongoing campaign to delegitimize the new incoming President is still ongoing. 
For those of us with long enough memories, the Democratic Party, their media operatives and the Clinton Campaign were claiming that Trump and the GOP would be engaged in this very same behavior after Hillary Clinton won the Presidency (as expected). 
Notice how the shoe is now on the other foot. 
It‚Äôs interesting reading past stories by ‚Äònews‚Äô sources linked to the Clinton Campaign and John Podesta as Politico has, who ran a feature on Aug 16th entitled, ‚ÄúWhy the GOP Will Never Accept President Hillary Clinton‚Äù which lays out the case of Hillary‚Äôs lock on the White House and how the evil Republicans will not accept her eventual election victory. 
‚ÄúWill Donald Trump respect the peaceful transition of power?‚Äù howled CNN‚Äôs Wolf Blitzer in the run-up to the election. The question now is: will the Democrats respect the result, and simply ‚ÄúMove On,‚Äù as they say? 
Of course, we now know that ‚Äòjournalists‚Äô like Wolf at CNN were getting their talking points directly the Clinton Campaign .

The Guardian 
A growing number of academics and activists are calling for US authorities to fully audit or recount the 2016 presidential election vote in key battleground states, in case the results could have been skewed by foreign hackers. 
The loose coalition, which is urging Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign to join its fight, is preparing to deliver a report detailing its concerns to congressional committee chairs and federal authorities early next week, according to two people involved. 
The document, which is currently 18 pages long, focuses on concerns about the results in the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in verifying the vote,‚Äù said Dr Barbara Simons, an adviser to the US election assistance commission and expert on electronic voting. ‚ÄúWe need to have post-election ballot audits.‚Äù Simons is understood to have contributed analysis to the effort but declined to characterise the precise nature of her involvement. 
A second group of analysts, led by the National Voting Rights Institute founder John Bonifaz and Professor Alex Halderman, the director of the University of Michigan‚Äôs center for computer security and society, is also taking part in the push for a review, and has been in contact with Simons. 
In a blogpost early on Wednesday, Halderman said paper ballots and voting equipment should be examined in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, warning that deadlines were rapidly approaching. 
‚ÄúUnfortunately, nobody is ever going to examine that evidence unless candidates in those states act now, in the next several days, to petition for recounts,‚Äù he said. 
The developments follow Clinton‚Äôs surprise defeat to Donald Trump in the 8 November vote, and come after US intelligence authorities released public assessments that Russian hackers were behind intrusions into regional electoral computer systems and the theft of emails from Democratic officials before the election‚Ä¶

While Richard Spencer‚Äôs half-joke of hailing Donald Trump with R oman salute rose a lot of dust, some remarks in his NPI speech point into rather sinister direction. A posthuman one. 
transcript with references and additional a/v material: 
Undoubtedly, there was a sigh of relief throughout the world when Hillary Clinton lost Presidential elections to Donald Trump. If for nothing else, then for the sake of quiet joy of watching adolescent commissars melt in tears ‚Äúbecause: racism, homophobia, xenophobia and whateverphobia‚Äù; it was a joy, and a relief, because it showed monolithic control system of moral nominalism , dubbed ‚Äúpolitical correctness‚Äù, to be a paper tiger. 
However, party is over and dialectics is back with the vengeance. As SJW s are, hopefully, moving out from the spotlight of post-historical stage, the new contender asserts his right to fashion the reality of our day and age into his own image. If we are to judge the day by the first gleam of dawn, this image will be just as ugly ‚Äì and just as unreal ‚Äì as hermaphrodite ideal of politically correct ‚Äú shitlib ‚Äù. 
In the words of more or less universally acclaimed leader of the ‚Äúalternative right‚Äù movement, Richard Spencer, in the future we are to deal with the leadership of ‚Äúchildren of the sun‚Äù. 
This is an interesting, and to my mind quite worrisome, statement of intent ‚Äì a manifestation of will, as Spencer would doubtless rectify me ‚Äì pointing out in many directions while seemingly focusing on the eternal ‚Äì and quite unidirectional ‚Äì circular movement of the pagan deity, revered by all self-respecting √ºbermenschen ‚Äì from Nietzsche to postmodern occultists. 
However, there‚Äôs a deeper astro-theological metaphor at work here. The ‚Äúpure eye that can gaze upon overabundance of joy without envy‚Äù (Nietzsche) in it‚Äôs virtual, postmodern, installment is not to be strictly represented by Swastika ‚Äì as Spencer apparently assumes, but by other, only seemingly ancient, symbol taken in fact from the world of tabletop and PC gaming and turned into ideological brand by Russian philosopher Alexander Dugin (or his minions): an individual widely promoted by core members of alt right movement. 
The symbol in question is an eight pointed star signifying the movement, not of sun, but of presumably primordial origin of everything: Chaos. 
In the lines to follow, we‚Äôll provide some preliminary analysis of the emerging situation: the channeling of chaos principle ‚Äì and adjacent chaos logic ‚Äì through loosely knit alt right movement, taking as a starting point some statements from Spencer‚Äôs speech held at NPI Conference in Washington D.C. on November 21 st . 

Triumph of the will or hipster Babylon working 

In introduction to his triumphal encomium to the ideological victory of alt right, embodied in the election of Donald Trump, Spencer makes one interesting remark: 
‚ÄúBut even though we always took Trump seriously, there was still a moment of unreality ‚Äì or perhaps too painfully intense reality ‚Äì when the state of Pennsylvania was called for Donald Trump, the moment when we knew Kek had smiled upon us, that meme magic was real. And though these terms are used half-jokingly, they represent something truly important‚Äìthe victory of will . We willed Donald Trump into office, made this dream into reality. ‚Äù 
It is all delivered in a manner of an in-joke, not to be taken too seriously. Moreover, to the uninitiated into mysteries of this Internet movement it is probably unclear who is ‚ÄúKek‚Äù and what exactly is ‚Äúmeme magic‚Äù. 
We‚Äôll start our explanation with lesser weirdness. 
‚ÄúMeme‚Äù is an expression denoting ‚Äúinexistent existent‚Äù, coined apparently by Richard Dawkins to explain how human thoughts fit in his evolutionary theology: memes are thoughts expressed in image and/or phrase which, by circulation in public, acquire the life and subsistence of their own and are able to ‚Äúinfect‚Äù the consciousness with their messages, like viruses. Meme is inexistent because there‚Äôs no such thing as thoughts having a biologically based self-subsistence and ability to procreate like viruses. Images and/or phrases are not living beings save by bad analogy that omits to tell us on what exactly it is based: what is that one principle making memes and viruses congenial. Yet they, quite paradoxically, exist because analogy apparently works . However no one seems to pose the question, why it works. 
Well, it works because it is magical. 

Chaos Magick 

Here we have an example of magical thinking in the postmodern ‚Äì in fact posthumanist ‚Äì vein, resting on assumption that what has not evolved in nature can ‚Äì and should ‚Äì be created in analogy to imagined process of evolution. If artificial construct is in line with ‚Äúprinciple of evolution‚Äù it is real or, to be more precise, it is in accordance with imaginary nature of this principle; it is imagined into existence . 
Therefore ‚Äúmeme magick‚Äù works only insofar it relies upon artificial, preferably technological medium for sustenance and on assumption that its recipients identify themselves with their artificial, preferably online identities that can indeed be imbibed with ‚Äúmemes‚Äù as they are in themselves artificial and arbitrary constructs. 
The goal of practitioner of such magic ‚Äì a far cry from what was traditionally considered to be magic ‚Äì is to change the world according to his will. This is, more or less, what is known from the Seventies of the last century as chaos magick , a postmodern imitation of ancient practice of acting in sub-human and sub-natural ‚Äúdomain‚Äù of the world, in the past mostly confined to people born with dubious talent to practice it. The peculiarity of chaos magick is, on the one hand, that it is entirely syncretic, i.e. that it uses everything that it‚Äôs practitioner can imbibe with intended, subjective, meaning, and that it relies on virtual, i.e. artificial world of mass culture, now embodied above all in Internet. 
The idea behind it all is that nothing is true and everything is possible . 
There are many interesting implications to this. 
The first is that everything is interrelated, i.e. that everything is connected with everything else. So any which way you take, you‚Äôll get where you want to get if you will it hard enough. The second is that there‚Äôs no hierarchy of higher and lower ‚Äì there‚Äôs only an infinite surface dissolving into ever more complex elements, dissolving in turn into nothingness, if concentrated upon. As there‚Äôs nothing higher, there‚Äôs nothing to be revered and everything can ‚Äì and indeed: should ‚Äì be an object of ironical laughter. And, most importantly, this is the world of dreams, ruled by what is usually called ‚Äúdream logic‚Äù but in actual fact: chaos logic or un-logic . 
In this sense, Richard Spencer quite accurately proclaimed Trump‚Äôs victory an accomplishment of meme- or chaos magick. 
Trump is willed into office by Internet memes binding the will of alt right adherents and turning their dream into reality ‚Äì virtual reality, one may add, yet reality nonetheless. The fact that Trump was elected for a plethora of motives ‚Äì from the appeal of his politics, to public takedown of Hillary Clinton by Wikileaks ‚Äì is immaterial, because in the world of chaos every subjective ‚Äúreality tunnel‚Äù, or interpretation of the world, is as real as any other. 
In this sense we can observe new ‚ÄúGod Emperor of USA‚Äù as a magical creation of Internet, by the Internet and for the Internet ‚Äì today still the Internet of interconnected computer nodes, but soon probably the Internet of things. If one is to push Spencer‚Äôs remark to it‚Äôs logical extreme, we can assert that illustrious Donald is the world‚Äôs first president of posthuman race; an embodiment of ultra progressive dream invoked to reality by professed ultra anti-progressive group. 
So that was lesser weirdness. Let us proceed now to high weirdness. 


We owe the reader an answer to a question: who the hell is Kek? 
Well, the reason why Spencer mentions him is again a magickal ‚Äúhalf-joke‚Äù: Kek is interpreted to be an ancient Egyptian deity by a number of Internet observers and identified with alt right memetic avatar ‚Äì Pepe the frog. While I habitually suspend judgment on all things Egyptian, because ancient Egyptian culture is a slippery ground even for experts, I consider this interpretation, upon closer inspection, to be quite valid in the virtual light of chaos logic. 
Namely, Pepe, the cartoon character, conceived in 2005. by cartoonist Matt Furie, emerged as a meme from the depths of Internet forums, more precisely: 4chan sub-forum /pol/, devoted to political discussions with no holds barred, which was, in view of some observers, a breeding ground for many alt right aficionados; a place of absolute freedom, therefore: absolute chaos. 
The expression ‚Äúkek‚Äù was also appropriated from the forums and stems from the in-joke among the players of World of Warcraft , replacing the standard Internet abbreviation ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù (‚Äúlaughing out loud‚Äù). Someone eventually noticed that Kek is in fact the name of frog-headed Egyptian deity, signifying Chaos and darkness, and Pepe was rebranded as Kek the deity ‚Äì ironic one, no doubt, half joking one, as surprisingly many alt righters like to put it, but deity nonetheless. 
It is important to point out that in view of the most ‚Äúesoteric Kekists‚Äù, that is: (half grinning) faithful of Kek/Pepe, the association was originally entirely haphazard and accidental, yet it developed into an ever growing system of synchronicities ‚Äì causally unrelated meaningful relations among events. So it came to pass that Kek sounds very similar to ‚Äòcuck‚Äô(originally: cuckservative), a term denoting old fashioned conservative who was still not ‚Äúred pilled‚Äù (another meme taken from pop culture, shared by both alt right and conspiracy theorists) by alt right or, should we assume: Kek himself; furthermore, Hillary Clinton addressed Pepe as nothing less than public enemy, identifying presumably the whole alt right movement with cartoon character. Then it happened that after this act Hillary fainted in front of the cameras, and that was immediately interpreted as an action of Kek. 
A good run-down of Kek/Pepe/Trump identification 
However, it all began with people noticing the numerical synchronicities in the random series of numbers in posts on /pol/ sub-forum: 
‚ÄûOne last thing you need to understand about imageboard culture: dubs. 
Every post on 4chan and similar venues comes with an 8-digit numerical stamp. This number represents that post‚Äôs entry position in the entire posting lineage of the imageboard. 
With the amount of traffic these sites get, the last couple digits of this number are essentially a random roll. When a poster gets repeated digits, its called ‚Äúdubs‚Äù, ‚Äútrips‚Äù, ‚Äúquads‚Äù, and so on. 
Since a poster can‚Äôt know their post number until after they‚Äôve submitted the post, its common for people to ‚Äúbet‚Äù the contents of their message on the occurrence of repeating digits (‚Ä¶) When that endeavor proves a successful, a ‚ÄúGET‚Äù has been made and the stroke of luck is celebrated. 
Out of this practice, a strange phenomenon began to take place on /pol/: discussion threads associated with Trump displayed noticeably frequent GETs. It wasn‚Äôt long before all of these seemingly random elements discussed so far became irreparably tied together within imageboard culture: Pepe the Frog (now /pol/‚Äôs unofficial mascot) Donald Trump (/pol/‚Äôs overwhelming candidate of choice) Repeating digit post numbers (‚ÄúGETS‚Äù) ‚ÄúKEK‚Äù (used as an expression of delight, particular in response to Trump‚Äôs ‚Äútrolling‚Äù of the establishment, as well as in reaction to unlikely GETs in general) 
‚Ä¶and a god was born.‚Äú ( source ) 

Synchronicities related to emergence of Kek the God and his merging with Trump in the bowels of Internet forums early on in the presidential campaign, are so numerous and, frankly, mind boggling that we cannot list them here, for the sake of brevity. For our purpose it is sufficient to point out that for many alt right aficionados, including core leadership, Kek is the God and Trump is his prophet, all declared with smug grin and ironical stance, yet with all the necessary power of conviction. 
Namely, chaos magick relies on laughter, or irreverence of its own principles because it is essentially un-principled. Fairly in accordance with its postmodern nature it seeks to deconstruct any kind of order to enable its ‚Äúpractitioner‚Äù to impose his own will and change the world ‚Äì as Spencer would put it: make his dreams a reality. 
I would go further and add: make all reality a dream ; because, chaos magick and alt right are nothing more but novel forms in the development of virtual, i.e. posthuman , world. The idea of adherence and reattachment to tradition that the alt right movement professes is nothing more but simulacrum appealing to people tired of liberal nihilism ‚Äì in its essence, however, it is a complete opposite: a disintegration of all substantial traditional principles ‚Äì above all an idea of preexistent hierarchy of Being ‚Äì into nothingness of primordial Chaos. 

Posthuman traditionalism 

I already developed this insight regarding the subversive work of Alexander Dugin, who is probably the most consequent subverter of Tradition with recognizable public persona acting in our age, but now we can see how his affiliates in USA and Europe are doing the same thing ‚Äì with less philosophical subtlety, but fueled by much greater raw power. Namely, alt right, if we are to judge by what it‚Äôs leadership advocates, is ideologically nothing more but project of building the simulated tradition ‚Äì something Richard Spencer likes to call ‚Äúpolitical theology‚Äù ‚Äì founded on New Age filtered Aryan myths , racial interpretation of Nietzsche and generally crossbred with ‚Äúdo your own thing‚Äù mentality, all done in the virtual ether of information technology. After all, if we are to agree with Spencer ‚Äì half jokingly of course ‚Äì that God Emperor was inaugurated by the act of Kek the God, then the victory of alt right ‚Äútraditionalists‚Äù is in fact the victory of technological magic; the act of pseudo magus waving the same wand Ray Kurzweill and his ilk offer to progressive lunatics . 
In the end, therefore, we are talking about another victory of posthumanism, branded, spontaneously or otherwise, as traditionalism. The obsession of alt right adherents with ‚Äúidentity‚Äù in general and ‚Äúwhite identity‚Äù in particular points to a fact that they are unable to realize the simple truth of Tradition they supposedly defend: they understand identity as something that can be created and not something that must be accepted . Observing the plethora of various, rather eccentric individuals in it‚Äôs vanguard, from macho gay postmodern Spartans to adherents to all kinds of exotic ‚Äì and to a large extent made up ‚Äì pagan religions one is at the lack to find a common denominator, save maybe for quite unchallenged neo-darwinist stance, especially to be found among ‚Äúgame‚Äù bloggers as Chateau Heartiste . If someone thinks that he can reattach himself to pre-modern spiritual history of humankind ‚Äì actually the only one there is ‚Äì while at the same time musing about ‚Äúalpha and beta males‚Äù, ‚Äúsexual market‚Äù, ‚Äúsignaling and counter-signaling‚Äù, professing therefore his proud monkey ancestry and reducing human relations to mental GMO of memes, genes and biological analogies, he is doing nothing else than unconsciously subverting the very thing he seemingly defends. 
The allure of alt right lies in it‚Äôs dialectical opposition to political correctness and rampart destruction of moral substance of the West, induced by process of globalization. Yet this is an eristic or, to use an excellent neologism invented by one correspondent of mine: discordian dialectic; the process of infinite division into ever multiplying opposites founded on the principle of Chaos. It is all done with the crooked half grin, a pinch of salt to every smug remark ‚Äì with irony of the man who knows he‚Äôs a liar and a cheat. But smug humor goes just a short way. In the end it morphs into sarcasm and irreverence of what should in fact be revered and subverts the very principles it professes to defend, far more effectively than dead serious PC brigade or techno loonies of posthumanist movement could ever hope for. 
We‚Äôll end with the word of warning to Christian adherents of alt right. The words have a definite meanings and power. There‚Äôs only one Chaos and there‚Äôs only one bringer of light from Chaos ‚Äì as some Kek worshipers already defined the poor Frog‚Äôs main job . And it‚Äôs not the One to be defined as ‚ÄúGod from God, Light from Light‚Äù, but ‚ÄúGod from Gutter, Light from Darkness‚Äù. A real Darkness shining in virtual brightness. Hope you guess His name. 
So, without a pinch of irony, I declare: be careful who your ‚Äúhail‚Äù.

21st Century Wire says‚Ä¶ 
If there was any doubt as to the intellectual bankruptcy and democratic decline of the EU‚Äôs super bureaucratic class, those doubts can finally be put to rest this week. It seems that Europe‚Äôs technocrats have truly surrendered to their own program of ‚ÄòEuro Red Scare‚Äô brainwashing. 
The new EU Resolution compares Russian media organizations to terrorist groups like ISIS (see full report below). The report also claims that Russian ‚Äú social media and internet trolls ‚Äù are somehow ‚Äú challenging democratic values .‚Äù The new anti-Russia legislation will now require many millions in funding to implement all of the ‚Äòanti-Russia‚Äô programs that bureaucrats believe are needed to counter this ‚Äògrave threat to democracy.‚Äô A touch oxymoronic, isn‚Äôt it? 
EU Parliamentarians appear to have lost the plot. Claiming that Europe is currently ‚Äòat war with Russia‚Äô is one thing, but the hysterical notion that ‚ÄúRussian propaganda‚Äù is somehow damaging the minds of Europeans is a whole new level of crazy. 
No wonder millions of Britons voted to leave the EU this past summer. 
The cold reality is that most of the ‚Äòdangerous views and information‚Äô aired on RT are by presenters, contributors and pundits ‚Äî westerners , not Russians. The reason RT‚Äôs audience ratings are growing is because the version of news and analysis being presented is resonating with international audiences who see RT‚Äôs reports as more accurate, and truthful than media monoliths like the BBC, CNN and other establishment outlets. By spending most of their time, effort and budgets crafting propaganda pieces to cover for the plethora of lies and clandestine operations globally, the western media are killing off their own relationship with domestic audiences. The age of talking down to the public and assuming them as fools is over. RT understood this in 2005 when their news network took shape. 11 years later, western media moguls are playing catch-up, albeit in vain.Sunset for Goebbels. Hamstrung with layers of management and editorial committees infested with intelligence agency operatives and journalists on the payroll of a Deep State star chamber that is so tangled in its own web of subterfuge ‚Äì obsessed with controlling real information, rather than disseminating it ‚Äì that their media environment has become too dysfunctional for its own good. They are simply unable to do authentic journalism, or speak truth to power . Incredibly, instead of working to help western media to phase out its own propaganda regime, ideologues in Brussels want to attack RT. 
The faceless force behind this latest xenophobic EU resolution are those in Washington, Paris and London who are still hell-bent on keeping anti-Russian economic sanctions in place ‚Äì much to the disservice of many European businesses and their workers who are losing out on trade with Russia. When Donald Trump is sworn in this January, the US-UK-EU anti-Russian axis could disintegrate within a year ‚Äì so this latest move by Brussels could be a last-ditch effort to do some damage as Europe‚Äôs NeoMcCarthyites plot their escape out the back door. From their disastrous coup d‚Äôetat in the Ukraine , to NATO‚Äôs hubris in the Baltic and beyond, and the EU‚Äôs ‚Äòmigrant crisis‚Äô debacle, and the tens of millions of Euros being laundered by EU member states through a pseudo NGO called the ‚Äò White Helmets‚Äô in Syria ‚Äì these last 3 years will certainly go down as one of the worst chapters in modern diplomatic history ‚Äì an abject failure of incompetent foreign policy, underpinned by a backward and confused ideology. 
We tried to find a coherent western reporting on this subject, but it seems even the western mainstream are too embarrassed to cover this bizarre Brussels adventure. See the following video and written report by RT International‚Ä¶ 
. RT MEPs in Strasbourg have voted on a non-legislative resolution which calls for the EU to ‚Äúrespond to information warfare by Russia.‚Äù RT and Sputnik news agency are alleged to be among the most dangerous ‚Äútools‚Äù of ‚Äúhostile propaganda.‚Äù 
The EU Parliament‚Äôs resolution demonstrates ‚Äú political degradation ‚Äù in regard to the ‚Äú idea of democracy ‚Äù in the West, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, commenting on the vote. 
Putin pointed out that while ‚Äú everyone tries to lecture ‚Äù Russia on democracy, European lawmakers themselves resort to a policy of restrictions, ‚Äú which is not the best way ‚Äù to deal with any issues. 
‚Äú The best approach is an open discussion, in which bright and solid arguments to support one‚Äôs point of view should be presented ,‚Äù Putin said. 
Adding that he hopes the Western move to ‚Äú counter Russian propaganda ‚Äù won‚Äôt lead to serious restrictions, the president congratulated RT and Sputnik journalists on their work. 
In the Wednesday vote, 304 MEPs supported the resolution based on the report ‚Äò EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against it by third parties ‚Äô, with 179 voting against it and 208 abstaining. 
Written by a Polish member of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, Anna Fotyga, the report alleged that Moscow aims to ‚Äú distort the truth, provoke doubt, divide the EU and its North American partners, paralyze the decision-making process, discredit the EU institutions and incite fear and uncertainty among EU citizens .‚Äù 
The report suggests that Moscow provides financial support to opposition parties and organizations in EU member states, causing disintegration within the bloc. 
At the same time, Russia is accused of ‚Äú information warfare ,‚Äù with such entities as RT TV channel, Sputnik news agency, Rossotrudnichestvo federal agency and the Russkiy Mir (Russian World) fund alleged to be among its most threatening propaganda ‚Äútools. ‚Äù 
The document places Russian media organizations alongside terrorist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL). 
The report also mentions some ‚Äú social media and internet trolls ‚Äù from Russia who are thought to ‚Äú challenge democratic values .‚Äù 
It called for the establishment of measures to tackle the perceived Russian propaganda threat, by means of ‚Äú investing in awareness raising, education, online and local media .‚Äù It also suggests stronger cooperation between the EU and NATO ‚Äú on strategic communication .‚Äù 
Sputnik has already appealed to the UN, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and a number of international journalists‚Äô organizations and NGOs, including Reporters Without Borders, to take measures to stop what it considers to be interference into freedom of speech in the EU. 
‚Äú The resolution hits straight at a number of respected media, including Sputnik agency, and has an aim to stop their activity in the EU. Moreover, the resolution bluntly contradicts the EU‚Äôs own human rights and freedom of press norms,‚Äù reads the letter signed by Sputnik Editor-in-Chief Margarita Simonyan. 
During the parliamentary debate that preceded the vote, MEPs campaigning for the resolution said the EU was ‚Äú at war with Russia, on a collision course with each other traveling faster than a jet fighter ,‚Äù and that with an alleged ‚Äú aim to split Europe, the Kremlin forces its information into our countries .‚Äù ","english","2016-11-25T23:06:47.899+02:00","21stcenturywire.com","US",,"EU Red Scare: Brussels Passes New Resolution to ‚ÄòCounter Russian Media Propaganda‚Äô",0.301,"http://i1.wp.com/21stcenturywire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/1-RU-REd-SCARE-RT.jpg?fit=610%2C413",0,0,0,0,0,"conspiracy"

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
COLUMBUS, OH (AP) ‚Äî History was made today in Columbus, Ohio when more than 3 million Amish poured into the city to see the American Amish Brotherhood (AAB), an organization which acts as an informal governing body for the Amish community, endorse Donald Trump for president. That number represents a significant portion of the total Amish population, which the United States Census Bureau says numbers more than 20 million men and women nationwide all pledging their vote to Trump for President. With the full force of the Amish community behind him, Donald Trump is now mathematically guaranteed to win the presidency in November. 
The organization typically meets once a year and the meetings usually consist of about 300 Amish leaders who meet to discuss the challenges, such as urban sprawl, that face the community. This year, however, the organization wanted as many people in attendance as possible so they can effectively instruct all Amish men and women of legal voting age to cast their vote for the flamboyant Republican nominee. 
The Amish, who are direct descendants of the protestant reformation sect known as the Anabaptists, have typically stayed out of politics in the past. As a general rule, they don‚Äôt vote, serve in the military, or engage in any other displays of patriotism. This year, however, the AAB has said that it is imperative that they get involved in the democratic process. 
‚ÄúOver the past eight years, the Democratic Party has launched a systematic assault on biblical virtues,‚Äù said AAB chairman Menno Simons. ‚ÄúWe have seen more and more Christians being persecuted for their faith; we have seen the state defile the institution of marriage. Now, they want to put a woman in the nation‚Äôs highest leadership role in direct violation of 1 Timothy 2:12. We need to stop this assault and take a stand for biblical principles. Donald Trump has shown in both action and deed that he is committed to restoring this country to the Lord‚Äôs way.‚Äù 
According to statistician Nate Silver of the website fivethirtyeight.com, there are no possible scenarios in which Hillary Clinton can win with Donald Trump carrying the Amish vote. 
‚ÄúThe Amish have their highest numbers in perennial swing states like Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa,‚Äù Silver noted. ‚ÄúThey also have strong numbers in reliably Democratic states like Michigan, Illinois, and New York, meaning that Hillary will lose those states as well. There is also a sizeable community in Florida which, while not as large as it is in the Midwest, is still large enough to turn Florida for Trump. Over the next two weeks, you can expect Hillary to enter into a state of freefall in all of my predictive models.‚Äù 
The Clinton campaign issued a written statement to the AAB asking them to reconsider their decision. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt believe that Donald Trump is the person who best represents your interests,‚Äù Clinton wrote to the AAB. ‚ÄúAs a career real estate developer, he represents a clear threat to your simple way of life. As former first lady of Arkansas, I understand the concerns of rural Americans more than any candidate in this election. I implore you to consider all of the facts before voting for my opponent.‚Äù 
Most pundits believe that Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs plea is too little too late. 
During a press conference in Manhattan, Trump thanked the AAB for their support and promised to put the Amish to work maintaining government buildings, which he said would save taxpayers millions because ‚Äúthe Amish do great work for a very low price.‚Äù 
Though Clinton has pledged to stay in the race until the very end, many of her campaign workers have already resigned. According to the Associated Press, it is expected that the Clinton campaign will lose 50% of its staff over the next two weeks. There is a general mood of hopelessness and despair in the Clinton camp, and many simply want to cut their losses. 
‚ÄúIt looked like she was going to win this election easily,‚Äù said Paul Horner, a campaign worker in Ohio, ‚ÄúBut this is what happens when you wake a sleeping giant. Cleary, Mrs. Clinton took far too much for granted in this race, and we are all now paying the price. It‚Äôs really sad to see the campaign end this way.‚Äù

(AP Photo / Dennis System) 
WASHINGTON, D.C. (AP) ‚Äî Following the results of Tuesday night‚Äôs election, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13805 , which orders a full recount of all votes cast in the election and calls for a special election to be held on December 19 th . Obama signed the order in response to the concerns of thousands of voters across the country who said that they were prevented from casting a ballot on election day , too many absentee ballots have not been found or counted , equipment failures, as well as concerns that some members of the electoral college may have acted unethically. 
‚ÄúPeople all over the country have been flooding my office with calls, telling my staff of horror stories about being harassed and intimidated by poll workers,‚Äù Obama told reporters. ‚ÄúMany have even said that they were flat out denied entry into the voting booths to cast their ballots if they were wearing a Hillary Clinton shirt or other signs showing support for her as President. This was especially bad in areas of Florida and North Carolina where there are high numbers of Latino and African American voters. We must investigate these claims. The margin of victory is too close to call, and the outcome of this election is too important. There is just too many legal challenges in too many states to just call this a victory for Trump.‚Äù 
Under the President‚Äôs order, the votes cast in all precincts nationwide will be recounted, and all poll workers who took part in Tuesday‚Äôs election will be subjected to strict background checks. This process is expected to take 30 days. In precincts where the Department of Justice has cause to believe that voter suppression has occurred, new elections will be held on Dec. 19 th, with those results being used to help determine who will represent the individual states in the electoral college. 
Not surprisingly, Donald Trump is not happy with the president‚Äôs decision. 
‚ÄúCrooked Hillary lost this election fair and square. They tried to rig this election against me, but the American people didn‚Äôt allow that to happen. President Obama doesn‚Äôt care about what the American people want. I said the system was rigged all along, and this proves I was right.‚Äù 
The president also said that the DOJ will be taking a close look at the members of the electoral college. 
‚ÄúWe have received information from a very reliable source that suggests there may have been some collusion between the members of the electoral college and poll workers in certain swing states. We still need to investigate these claims, but if they are true, we will take all the appropriate actions necessary.‚Äù 
Paul Horner, a professor of political science at UCLA, believes that the issues with the electoral college run much deeper that this election. 
‚ÄúMost people feel that it is their right as citizens to pick the president of the United States, but there is nothing in the constitution that says that. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200,000 votes , but because of the electoral college, she still lost. That decision is reserved solely for the 538 electors who meet in their respective states on December 19 th . What the people are actually voting for are their states‚Äô electors, not for the President. Though the system is odd and unfair, it has persisted because many insist that it works just fine as it is, with the winner of the popular and electoral vote usually matching. That does not mean, however, that it will continue to work just fine in the future. The way the system is set up could cause it to malfunction in some potentially terrifying ways, this recent election being one of them.‚Äù 
Political Analyst Matt Daemon told ABC News that he agrees with the President‚Äôs Executive Order and said that he would like to see the electoral college done away with altogether. 
‚Äú[The electoral college] is a f‚Äîking joke; we should be using the popular vote instead. It may have made sense in 1788, but so did the three fifths compromise . Everyone should have an equal vote, and that‚Äôs just not the case with the electoral college. You know what the electoral college gave us? It gave us George W. Bush. It gave us a war in Iraq, and the worst recession since the great depression. It‚Äôs time to bring our system into the 21 st century. I hope Obama fixes this, because president Trump is going to be a nightmare.‚Äù 
Obama finished up the press conference explaining his plans for moving forward. 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to investigate the FBI into their role in all of this,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúWhy did FBI director James Comey on Sunday say that the agency is not recommending charges against Clinton after reviewing all of her emails; declaring Hillary Clinton a free women conveniently just one day before the election? Why wasn‚Äôt this news released earlier? How many votes were lost because of this?‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúIf all of these questions cannot be answered by our deadline set in December, a recount will be ordered.‚Äù 
If you have any questions about the recount or the special December 19 th election , you can call the Obama administration‚Äôs special election hotline at (785) 273-0325.

""Concern Grows Over Soros-Linked Voting Machines   
Sixteen states may be using balloting equipment from a company tied to the leftist billionaire

Concern is growing over revelations that voting machines in a significant number of states could be linked to a company tied directly to billionaire leftist George Soros and his personal quest to create a nationless, borderless global state. 

The U.K.-based Smartmatic company posted a flow-chart on its website that it had provided voting machines for 16 states, including important battleground states like Florida and Arizona. Smartmatic Chairman Mark Malloch-Brown is a former U.N. official and sits on the board of Soros‚Äô Open Society Foundations. Since the story first broke, the flow-chart has disappeared from Smartmatic‚Äôs website, raising further questions about the real status of the Soros-tied voting equipment and whether it is truly being deployed in U.S. elections. 

If Malloch-Brown's Soros ties weren't troubling enough, he also has ties to the Clintons through his work at two consulting firms. 

According to a spokesperson for the National Association of Secretaries of State, Smartmatic is not on a list of federally certified providers for election systems and officials in several states‚Äô have contested that their equipment came from Smartmatic. Why, then, had Smartmatic bragged about providing over 50,000 voting machines for U.S. elections?""

B2 ABSTRACT  
In the preferred embodiment, the invention is a data entry device intended for use by voters during an election to enter selected choices. Its basic functions are to display available options and accept voter input. Its design achieves simplicity in its preparation, deployment, and operation at any given electoral event. It also furnishes accuracy, reliability, durability, and reusability. It connects in a standard protocol to a voting station's host processor. It accepts up to 300 key codes, each one potentially a unique selection. Names, symbols, or pictures identifying candidates are printed on a paper template compliant with the device's geometry, inserted prior to an election, and visible through the device's transparent cover. When the number of candidates or valid options in a contest exceeds its capacity, additional identical units can be chain-connected, until a sufficient number of voting options are available.
